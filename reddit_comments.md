**Yeetus_Deletus_6969** (👍 18753): My primary school teacher did this while he was our home teacher and we would always get some cake and pizza. But then he was going through a divorce and honestly that man looked so broken near the end of the year but the whole staff gave him a party for the end of the year and I never saw him so happy. I dont know what happened to him afterwards but I know he's still teaching in primary school.

Edit: wow this is insane, and I will try to contact them because honestly they deserve this love

Edit 2: Finally contacted them and we had a chat, he is happily retired and remarried and is happy that you guys sent so much kindness his way

  ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 Yeetus_Deletus_6969 (👍 5560): If you know how to get in touch with him it may be worth sending a message to him and let him know you appreciated him! 

You never know how much a simple message will mean to someone

    ↳ **Reveen_** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 662): This, for real. 

I'm not a teacher or anything, but recently received a message from a kid I went to HS with (I graduated in 2002). He thanked me for being nice to him and treating him like a person unlike most of the other students. He brought up the time that I defended him in front of a big group of classmates about his hobbies (drawing and computer games) and how he was planning on killing himself since he thought everyone hated him. He also had a shitty home life, lots of bullies, and had aspergers syndrome. 

It looks like his life is going great now and he has his own family.

I had sort of forgotten that whole situation since it was so long ago, but it was really nice to hear that I was able to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if I was kind of a loser in high school too.

      ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 Reveen_ (👍 158): Good on you for being nice to people!

      ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 Reveen_ (👍 6): Damn what kind of student group doesn't like drawing and computer games enough to gang up on someone who does like them?

I feel like these days every kid on the planet likes computer games. Times sure have changed.

      ↳ **stillethel960** 回复 Reveen_ (👍 6): That is fantastic! You never know what some people are going through. A random kind word, a random harsh word... Twice, in hs, I was planning on killing my self - once actually had the pills in my hand and both times, a friend happened to call. Lesson: if you decide to share anything, share kindness.

      ↳ **sky_is_the_next_pewd** 回复 Reveen_ (👍 2): Your probably not a loser if you're able to defend people from bully's

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Reveen_ (👍 1): That feels man. I have been diagnosed with Asperger’s and adhd and I feel like the world is crushing down on me with not relent and I have had plans but never executed… I guess it might get better after high school

      ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 [deleted] (👍 660): For sure! Teachers deserve way better treatment than they get from both students and employers! 

If you’re a teacher than thanks for doing gods work chief, and on behalf of your students: you’re great, keep on keeping on

Although some teachers do work their students too hard and while not always the case, there have been a few teachers ice had that don’t seem to realize that kids and teens can be utter dicks without meaning to. Which is why some of my favorite teachers are the ones that never shout or scold the students and take the time to be understanding.

        ↳ **revcio** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 323): My biology teacher in high school straight up went on diss battles against us and many times she won

          ↳ **Impedus11** 回复 revcio (👍 221): My bio teacher was a girl from south La who worked her way up from nothing, no way were we privileged Australian white boys ever going to be able to out diss her but we tried

            ↳ **god_avocado** 回复 Impedus11 (👍 95): This is what I love about reddit. Its the best place to tell stories anonymously and everyone here thinks the same and accepts you. If you got a story to tell, tell it on reddit.

              ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 god_avocado (👍 76): I once jumped and hit my head on a ceiling fan (big sharp metal fucker) going *fast* 

Had a bone from my skull removed and spent 2 months in a hospital and spent like a year without any bone in my skull on the left side of my forehead

                ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 61): I am so fucking sorry about what happened to you but the randomness of the story and the way you told it gave me the hardest laugh in months

                  ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 71Atlas (👍 38): Sounds horrendous, but it’s just so bizarre that I mainly use it as a cool/funny story to tell, and laugh while telling it xD

                    ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 6): That's the coolest way of dealing with that kind of metal fan PTSD. I'm also a little relieved, I was feeling a little bad for laughing since that bastard fucked your head pretty badly

                      ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 71Atlas (👍 8): I mean it was a pretty even fight, the fam blade was bent after that (I’ve often been told I have a very thicc skull, and that probably saved my life

                        ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 7): At least the fan learned his lesson then. Your dry humor is dope, I'm sure that thicc head is there to protect an even thiccer brain

                          ↳ **god_avocado** 回复 71Atlas (👍 5): That boi is thicc

                        ↳ **Freelance_Sockpuppet** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 3): You’d have to have a pretty thick skull to pick a fight with a fan /s

But really, did you not realise the fan was there was was the goal to jump to it?

I caught a wooden bat to the dome that split the skin really good and the doctor said I must have a thick skull to have not come out with major concussion

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 4): At least you aren’t a bonehead anymore.

              ↳ **BanthaMilk** 回复 god_avocado (👍 2): the reason everyone on reddit thinks the same is because no one is allowed to have their own opinion, thanks to the almighty downvote. we've literally had to create a subreddit called unpopular opinion just so people can share their general personal thoughts and ideas without being downvoted to oblivion and losing all their karma to a comment which includes an opinion that is not generally accepted by people. reddit literally has almost no freedom of speech because of this platform's nature to get into arguments about the smallest things e.g. I was in a discussion and I mentioned something about how Ancient Rome had freedom of religion and this guy replied to me saying "wHaT aBoUt ThE pErSeCuTiOn Of ChRiStIaNs?!?!?".

              ↳ **chabbleor** 回复 god_avocado (👍 1): I love sea food, with the exception of shrimp. I thought, "shrimp is the most basic sea food there is, so if I love sea food, I must love shrimp." So every time I go out with friends or whoever and get dinner, if shrimp is on the menu in some dish, I order it. But every time so far, I have not enjoyed it at all and ended up regretting ordering the shrimp soup or whatever. My friends now question my love of sea food.

          ↳ **Tinmanred** 回复 revcio (👍 1): Same here man I almost had to scrap got a detention for what I said back

          ↳ **Nannobot12** 回复 revcio (👍 1): My bio teacher was a young guy like 25-30 and since he was young none of the classes would interact with him as our teacher but rather our friend it reached the point where he became the leader to every thing the school does like any events was led by him and really he was a fine man bo one was afraid of asking him anything and we loved him for it.

        ↳ **Def_Not_Alt_Acct** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 42): I had this one teacher in middle school who was an 80 year old irish lad. In a section about how the US won the Revolutionary War he explained that the US troops were farmers and hunted more frequently and to show this he had one group train for ten minutes by throwing paper balls at targets while the other just sat there and then had us line up and throw paper at each other

          ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 Def_Not_Alt_Acct (👍 9): Sounds fun

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Def_Not_Alt_Acct (👍 8): [deleted]

            ↳ **sigmaluckynine** 回复 [deleted] (👍 8): Yeah but that was the first instance of industrialized warfare where training started to lose out in effectiveness

        ↳ **Mysterious_Lesions** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 54): I cringe at how callous we were in high school with some of our teacher nicknames. I sometimes wish I could go back and slap teenage me. Don't get me wrong, I was pretty polite in most ways, but I definitely yielded a lot more to peer pressure on how to view teachers than I should have.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 2): But don't raise their salaries. They are just teaching the future \s

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 -20): Wait... I thought God's work was being a fictional being used as an excuse for mass killings.....

      ↳ **Clumsy_Chica** 回复 [deleted] (👍 105): I so wish I could remember my fifth grade teacher's first name... It was close to 20 years ago but he was the one who kickstartred my love of science by having us do about 400% more science projects (poster board and all...) than any other fifth grade class that year.  

I threw a soccer ball at his face once when we were playing at recess and he put me in timeout, I was dealing with a lot of shit at home and wasn't processing my anger at all.  I really badly want to apologize, and thank him, but it's been so long and I can't seem to find him :(

        ↳ **YourTypicalBoss** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 61): Honestly there’s certain things I want to get off my chest to certain teachers too. I never did anything like throwing a ball into a teacher’s face, but as a class we badgered the fuck out of a lot of teachers, particularly a really old Christian brother who (ironically) taught science. Because of his age we messed with him a lot (some really funny shit ngl but nonetheless cruel), but I know at least 3 guys who majored in a science field in college because of him.

          ↳ **Mysterious_Lesions** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 22): In our school, there was a tonne of badgering of the bus driver as well. It would be totally unacceptable to do this for a public transit driver.

School kids on this topic: You can be better than me.

          ↳ **SmokkeyDaPlug** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 3): Oh man how I feel this. Not all teachers I fucked aroubd with deserved it but there were some that all year it was war and I dont regret that shit.

            ↳ **2red2carry** 回复 SmokkeyDaPlug (👍 4): Some had it coming

              ↳ **SmokkeyDaPlug** 回复 2red2carry (👍 2): Most def

            ↳ **tumeskin** 回复 SmokkeyDaPlug (👍 2): I'm 13 and if a teacher is strict thats ok, but I have one teacher who is an petty bish and multiple times shes given me an write-up thing for "not even trying to do my homework" although i've genuinely tryed my best so at first I was getting depressed over it, but since then I've started to not care about her and if she says something really stupid to me i'm sure as hell gonna talk back. But luckily all my other teachers are pretty nice and understanding.

              ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 tumeskin (👍 3): She is trying to convince you that you can do better. This is exactly the future regret you could be learning from in this thread lol

              ↳ **SmokkeyDaPlug** 回复 tumeskin (👍 -2): They got it out for you you just gotta show them exactly that.  That you dont care and if they wanna keep playing that its gonna be a loooong year for them. Lol

          ↳ **Crashbrennan** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 3): It's easy to forget that for hundreds of years, most science was done by Christian monks and Islamic scholars. Religion and science aren't as wholely incompatible as people think.

            ↳ **YourTypicalBoss** 回复 Crashbrennan (👍 3): True completely forgot about that

          ↳ **gibbee530** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 1): Surely you are not suggesting that because was a Christian that he shouldn't be teaching Science? HAHA just busting your chops😝😝😝😝

        ↳ **mronion82** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 17): There might be a Facebook group for the school- mine was tiny, about 600 pupils, but it's got a busy FB page with people who left decades ago. There's also likely to be a few people who never mentally left school and I bet they can name they guy you're talking about very quickly.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 23): My 5th grade teacher just died last year (over 20 years after 5th grade). He was such a legend that there were probably 75 former students in their 20s and 30s that he taught when they were 11. I hope I can make an impact like that one day.

          ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I'm gonna guess he taught way more than 75 kids in that time

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Well yeah, but I'm pretty sure most teachers have zero former students at their funerals.

              ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Oh, you left that part out. That make more sense now.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 4): You could call the school and ask them for the teachers name I bet

          ↳ **Clumsy_Chica** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Last time I tried they said they couldn't give me information on past teachers unless I knew their name and was calling for a reference... That was a few years ago, I'll try again.

        ↳ **BongRipsMcGee420** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 3): Call your school and ask

        ↳ **gritbiddy90** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 1): Maybe u find out more info about him through your former classmates?

      ↳ **Hiazi** 回复 [deleted] (👍 4): Just sent an email to an old english teacher because of this comment. One of my faves. I'm a little surprised she's still at it... she wasn't exactly a spring chicken when I was there nearly a decade ago.

But I'm glad she is. I think now, more than ever, kids need a kind guiding hand, and she fit the bill perfectly. Real sweet old grandmotherly type.

      ↳ **Silfurstar** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): The best part of the job for me was always past students getting in touch and bringing up events, situations or even details that I had forgotten but that they remembered because it meant something to them.

I still stopped teaching last year. In part because I have another career I want to focus on, but mostly because of too many times coming home broken and discouraged. I wanted to keep teaching at least one or two days a week, but I just couldn't handle it anymore.

I'm hoping this break will allow me to come back to it in some form in the future.

      ↳ **kaaaaath** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): I also like to do this to teacher who were evil to me.

My first day of college I was in OChem and my AP Chem teacher was my professor. When we had to take actual roll that one day she was like “your name sounds so familiar!” And I was like “...that’s because you told me last year I wouldn’t even go to college, Mrs. Resler.”

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): I added a lot of my old teachers (the ones I liked anyway) as friends on FB/LinkedIn. Initially it was as a reference, admittedly, but after a while of getting to know them it turns out the same people who I used to think were annoying for keeping me inside during lunch and making me stay after school were actually really cool people that were just looking out for their student's best interest. I still talk regularly with my freshman year science teacher for example, and my old IT teacher (I went to tech school instead of a traditional high school) provided priceless information for navigating college as a CS student during my first year. I was extremely lucky to have great teachers and I appreciate them a lot for the foundation they gave me and for showing me that there can be joy in learning.

      ↳ **Sunny_yet_rainy** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): This year, which was my first year out of homeschool, i had decided to email all my teachers at the end of the year saying thank you and had emailed a drawing of said teacher i had made.

      ↳ **spooner248** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): It also feels awesome to let a teacher know this. It lets you reflect on how far you’ve come and how you had some good role models in the past. It’s a win-win

      ↳ **fullmetalmerlin** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): So true and incredibly important!

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): My dad's teacher in primary school was an artist, she would have the class draw three lines and turn them into different drawings, she turned my dad's into a genie. Years later my dad got his first tattoo, that genie. He got into contact with the teachers daughter and when he tried to show that teacher she yelled at him and told him to leave.

        ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Was the tattoo on his ass?

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): No, its on his back and its giant, takes up his whole back

            ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Yeah, if a dude started to remove his shirt at me, I'd probably shut that down quick too

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Uhm, why do you have to assume it was like that? I don't appreciate you assuming such a thing about my father. Literally just a dude who thought someone's custom art for him was good enough to get it tattooed onto him. And why did you assume it was on his ass?

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Also her problem wasn't him being shirtless it was that he got it tattooed onto him

                  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That could be support creepy, she might've thought his sincere gesture was showing obsessive stalker tendencies, you don't know her life lol jeez, why yell at me for it?

                    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): I didn't tell at you

                      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Yell* Fucking Phone

                ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): The ass part was obviously a joke, and everything I said was gleaned from finding a rational explanation for your description of her reaction. Calm your chodes.

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Chode* I'm pretty calm. If what you said what a joke congrats, to me it came off as sorta condescending.

                    ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Trying to see another person's perspective shouldn't seem like a condescending thing.

                      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): It doesn't diminish your perspective to examine others', I mean

      ↳ **DaksTheDaddyNow** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That would fuel me for years. 

I taught a fourth grader to read my first year. It's my greatest achievement as a teacher. I hope he's doing well, it's only been a couple of years.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Bruh. In my country it‘s illegal to chat online with your teacher or have their number

      ↳ **pixlkiss** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): This makes me so happy. I've had a drunken night or two where I emailed teachers from high school and expressed regret for skipping class and assignments, and told them how they made an impact in my life and what I'm doing now. I send a good message drunk; nothing emotional or weird. But when I wake up the morning after I always regret it and feel like they're probably like "Yeah you sucked". Now I'm really glad I sent them.

      ↳ **major84** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): >  "Thank you for everything you did, I'm sorry I was an utter shit. I'm now doing

doing time in prison for murdering a dude that reminded me of you, that one time when you gave me F on my project.

      ↳ **KDawG888** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): > Thank you for everything you did, I'm sorry I was an utter shit.

The teachers I disrespected I usually did so because I didn't like them. I wouldn't reach out to them. I'd reach out to a teacher I liked who showed mutual respect (or at least pretended to)

There are good teachers but there are also plenty bad ones.

        ↳ **OverlordWaffles** 回复 KDawG888 (👍 2): Yeah, I've only done it once, and it was for a college teacher. 

The teachers I were disrespectful to were the ones that repeatedly did so to me. I heard recently of one that was a complete asshole 24/7 was then working at a gas station near where I worked and I really wanted to go in there and give him a hard time. I didn't end up going though

    ↳ **Azureflamedemon** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 257): Especially teachers, they already always feel like they aren't appreciated enough.

      ↳ **InkTide** 回复 Azureflamedemon (👍 71): Pretty sure it's more than a 'feeling'.

        ↳ **Azureflamedemon** 回复 InkTide (👍 13): You definitely have a point!

      ↳ **alexalex19921992** 回复 Azureflamedemon (👍 1): Not true. Do ur job you have students thanking u. I was a pos until I got this teacher who wasn’t having it. I wouldn’t be an attorney without him being s good teacher rather than a lazy bum.

    ↳ **TehFuriousOne** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 50): Especially for a teacher. My GF is a high school math teacher in a underprivileged school. She deals with a lot of bullshit, way more than I ever would have put up with. She's said it at least a dozen times, the thing that makes it worth it is when she gets that rare "thank you" from one of the kids she helped.

      ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 TehFuriousOne (👍 5): Well from a student: tell her thanks for putting up with all the bullshit of the system as well as the students, we may not always be the Best But good teachers make us want to be better!

    ↳ **MikeWFU** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 5): My aunt was a high school teacher, she always loved seeing what her old students had done. She'd ask her classes to email her a year or two down the line and tell her how they where doing/what they'd chosen to do after school. Some teachers really care about their students and love to hear back.

      ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 MikeWFU (👍 2): I love the kinds of teachers you can keep in touch with after school.

    ↳ **CrimsonSpeedster** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 3): This! The best part of the beginning of this year has been my 8th graders from last year still reaching out to me and asking questions about how to prepare for high school. This is my second year teaching so already making connections like that makes me feel so good about my approach with my students.

    ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 3): See, I love reaching out to people just to wish them well. I don't do it for anything other to tell the person I hope they are doing well or something like that.

I posted on relationship advice a long time ago asking if I should reach out to my cousin whom I no longer talk to. Someone basically talked me out of it by saying something like "what do you hope to achieve by doing that?" 

I honestly couldn't give an answer and it has made me second guess reaching out to alot of other people.

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 Jackal7112 (👍 2): Sometimes toxic people don't "come around" to better habits, unfortunately. Even if they're family, it's often just more of the same when your growth alone isn't enough.

        ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): It wasn't even a toxic relationship between me and them. We kind of just stopped talking. I don't think my parents were very fond of them, but that's about the only reason. When I was younger, the only time we ever really saw them was when someone was dying.

I reached out to her and told her I appreciate her right before my heart transplant. 

She told me she was questioning her life and whatever she did if it was worth it. And thanked me tremendously.

                      ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 MammothImplement1066 (👍 2): I saw a document of my own school (high school) and the teachers made around 90-120k, some quite a bit more. I’m in Canada tho

            ↳ **SLEDGEHAMMAA** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): In the west, it's still a lot, but not an incredible amount if it's only once a year. $100 is only like 2 or 3 days or working minimum wage

          ↳ **msndrstdmstrmnd** 回复 WubbaLubbaDubStep (👍 7): Have you even seen teachers salaries? And in addition a lot of teachers pay for a ton of their classroom’s supplies out of pocket because of such low funding for schools. A lot of teachers work two or three jobs because their teaching salary alone can’t sustain them

            ↳ **Scam_unlikely11111** 回复 msndrstdmstrmnd (👍 1): My history teacher has ten year and has out dated books and charges 400 for them to be replaced he has a Camaro and a mini fridge he doesn't pay for none of his school stuff and when he did was a long ass time ago

That's still an awful lot for a teacher to just spend out of pocket when they're paid shit and have to bring their own personal supplies into school.

          ↳ **czs5056** 回复 cavemaneca (👍 23): Obviously pizza won't cost $1000, but I wanted to throw a figure out there that would allow a person to buy 30 some odd pizzas at a time and not think twice about it.

        ↳ **grunt_amu2629** 回复 czs5056 (👍 -53): You can get like 30 Jack's pizzas for $90. LMFAO.  Y'all are salty, broke as fuck, and have no idea how to bargain hunt.. probably why you are struggling.  $1000 for pizza's??  Where the fuck you shoppin' my man.

          ↳ **The_Asia-Boy** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 17): He didn't meant only for pizza. He meant it in general. Are you not qbke do realise that there are people who need every cent they earn???

          ↳ **czs5056** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 8): It's not 1k for pizza, it's 1k of money that can be spent on anything after paying bills. Since this is being done at the school we need to assume that it's hot pizza being delivered not frozen unless the school is going to allow the teacher to use an oven in the kitchen

      ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 6): A) they're not talking about 1 pizza they're most likely talking about 20+, maybe even 30+.

B) teachers aren't paid minimum wage or anything but you certainly aren't getting wealthy as a teacher. Many of my teachers needed a second job to keep up with normal bills.

C) the comment you responded to was quite obviously hyperbole. Get better at reading comprehension.

        ↳ **Hazardish08** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 2): Also the fact that a lot of teachers have families meaning some 50-60k a year doesn’t seem that much and they will run low on cash a few times.

        ↳ **LethalSalad** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 1): Still, around 30 cheap pizzas would be like 60 bucks, that's pretty doable for a once-a-year thing or something. She sounds like one of those good teachers who genuinely enjoy their students' happiness, so that would be pretty worth it.

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 2): I don't think you couldn't find 30 pizzas for 60 bucks for a school party. Even at the grocery store, if you could get 30 of their cheapest pizzas it would most likely still be more than $60. I don't recall ever seeing a full pizza for less than 2 bucks. This school would also have to have a bunch of large ovens that are available for use (which they very well could). 

Getting them delivered is really the only reasonable way to have 30 pizzas all ready to eat at the same time.

Edit: just my thoughts, I'm no pizza party planning expert

          ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 0): Where you finding $2 pizzas? Would probably be more like $150 which can be a sizable amount for someone living paycheck to paycheck as many teachers do. But, again, the key takeaway is the comment was hyperbolic, it isn't meant to be taken literally.

In germany teachers arent underpaid to a point where they even struggle to survive on 2 jobs.

Sorry, I didn't mean to go all ACKSHUALLY on you, I was just venting some frustration having worked with teachers in Germany.

          ↳ **HazelnitBoyyy** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): A good part of America pays their teachers atleast decently. Where Im from, the teachers start at around 60k and make around 100k a year by the end. Plus, teachers get more time off than most jobs (not justifying them getting paid too little, im just saying it isnt as bad as it seems)

            ↳ **Aggravating-Abroad44** 回复 HazelnitBoyyy (👍 1): There’s more jobs that don’t pay than do. My wife’s been a teacher at 4 locations in Ohio and still makes half of what her pay should be. She has 10 years of experience. The problem with teaching is that you rarely get hired for experience but because your family. I’ve seen people sub for a decade and still not get hired when a spot opens.

        ↳ **gojirra** 回复 Samsuxx (👍 2): I get your point,  that all teachers everywhere deserve more. Honestly yes, bless them, but some societies actually do value teachers and pay them fair wages.

      ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 2): I dunno.    30.4 cents per kilowatt hour and 5.50$ gasoline in germany.   Still seems underpaid to me.

        ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 5): 5,50?
Petrol's 2,17-1,50€ per litre

          ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): I'm comparing to America since thats what the underpaid teacher salary is about.    And. I'm comparing here gallons vs germany in gallons.   There's about 3.7 liters in a gallon and every euro is about 1.18 USD   If then compared to here that teacher in germany is essentially paying 6.49 USD to 9.47 USD per gallon of gas.   Or gas is around 1.89 in most places with California being one of the highest by far at 3.27.

I'm just saying its still seems like tewchee get underpaid in general when compared to cost of living in a lot of places.

        ↳ **gojirra** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 5): Ok oil subsidy lobbyist. Imagine trying to guess the cost of living based on gas and electricity alone lol.

        ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 2): But 1. You don't need to drive as far as in the USA and 2. Stuff like rent is cheaper over here, as long as you don't live in the top 5 cities.

          ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 KingBellmann (👍 1): "You don't need to drive as far in the US?" Pff, ok. People here drive over an hour to get to work, as a general minimum, so I don't know your frame of reference here. I've always had to leave at LEAST an hour before my shift in all of the places I've lived or worked. My mom does the same. The United States are vastly spread out, with most states being filled with farm lands and ranches, meaning "town" is further away from homes. Even in cities, though, it takes forever to get anywhere because of congestion and traffic and construction. I can't think of any experience where I didn't work pretty far from where I lived unless I was in high school. Even when I worked in LA, a ton of my coworkers drove to their jobs from Palmdale or Lancaster, even Santa Clarita isn't very close.

How the f far are you driving in Germany to reach this conclusion, and why would anyone drive further than that?? I'm totally amazed if it's further!

            ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 laughingashley (👍 5): I said that germans do NOT drive as far and much as Americans, therefore we don't need as much fuel and higher fuel prices hurt less...

        ↳ **SpiderFlame04** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): That’s better than my middle school in Kansas. Most of the teachers were giving kids an extra credit point to buy a box of Kleenex for them because there wasn’t any class funds budget.

          ↳ **akatherder** 回复 SpiderFlame04 (👍 2): It's standard in our kids' elementary school that every kid brings in some ziploc bags, tissue, hand sanitizer, etc. during the first week.  It's part of the "School supplies list."  Then the teacher makes it available to everyone throughout the year.  We're a upper-middle class suburb.

            ↳ **SpiderFlame04** 回复 akatherder (👍 2): I get that, but you’d think they’d give free tissues to an eighth grade class

      ↳ **PostsOnGamedesign** 回复 AsymmetricPanda (👍 1): Would you actually being comfortable paying tax money to fund pizzas?

        ↳ **AsymmetricPanda** 回复 PostsOnGamedesign (👍 2): Yes, if it’s just leftover budget that was assigned to teachers for class supplies. Some of teacher salary comes from taxes and they probably spend some of it on pizza anyway

  ↳ **cuentaderana** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 2): When I taught K on the Navajo Nation I bought snack for my class(they were scheduled to go from 8am to 12pm before eating, not easy for 5 year olds). I think I spent about 100 a month. I tried to buy what was on sale(graham crackers, animal crackers, goldfish, apple sauce) but once a week I wanted to make sure they got fresh produce(tangerines, bananas, carrots). There were times I are beans for breakfast lunch and dinner so my class could eat. My students would always get so excited on fresh fruit day, a lot of them didn’t have it at home.

  ↳ **Altissia-senpai** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 1): I remember my teachers (chorus and history teacher) were doing a pizza party and I personally know they use their own money for this stuff. At the time I had an allowance from my family about 30 bucks and I offer to help with the pizza party in both by getting several (like 6) sodas: two diets and the rest regular sodas. (I am diabetic and I know some other people who have diabetes in the class) later in middle school I was known as a Soda dealer (and candy dealer too since I always carry candy).

  ↳ **PurpleSunCraze** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 1): In 3rd grade I had a teacher that talked non-stop about all the amazing things she and her classes in the past did.  All kinds of field trips, costume days all the time to learn about history, building castles and forts in class, teaching outside while the students played, just nuts stuff that sounded awesome to us.  

That said, we never saw any of it.  Anytime any of us didn’t the slightest thing wrong she said we lost the privilege.  Like the slightest thing, someone came in 5 seconds late, it was canceled.  Then she would go on for 10 minutes about how awesome the stuff was but we didn’t get it.

Years later towards the end of high school it someone got randomly brought up at a party and her nephew over heard me and laughed his ass off.  Turned out she never did that with any class, ever.  It was just some bullshit she made up to get her students to behave.

Later on that year his father died and shortly after he found out his wife was having an affair with the vice principal.  He ended up shooting himself and I was heartbroken.

      ↳ **Fireverse** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): And I mean... If your husband's father just died, wait a little to cheat again or idk, be more discrete about it (I know I sound like I'm vouching for cheaters which I absolutely am not, they're one of the worst scums in the universe, I'm just saying that maybe if there's a chance of someone finding out you're cheating on them, maybe try and make it happen not right after their dad's death).

      ↳ **woosterthunkit** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): I was talking to another redditor really as friends and he gaslit me good, then I realised he'd prob gotten alot on practice when cheating on his now ex wife

      ↳ **QuartzPuffyStar** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): > Thats why I don't understand cheaters 

People love differently , different people and for a different time. People also get horny with other people. People also get bored, lazy and don't know how to communicate. Some people just can't have one partner.  


Only one of those can be reason enough to cheat. 

Usually people go with a couple. 

Life is complex, love is complex, or it is made that way by the simplified expectations  and hopes that culture embeds in people since early ages.

        ↳ **Suekru** 回复 QuartzPuffyStar (👍 3): Then leave your partner. The only time “cheating”
Is acceptable is perhaps the cheater is in an abusive relationship and can’t leave at the moment.

But even then I’d advise against it for their safety if their SO is abusive.

        ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 QuartzPuffyStar (👍 1): That's why I think people should only marry if they've been together for _several_ years and are _100%_ sure they've met their soul mate and BFF.

I reckon the cultural perception should shift from being so focused on having a partner for life (especially in countries with less and less people having kids) and instead be more communal, if that makes sense. Don't focus on loving one person but understand you may love multiple.

      ↳ **cityofbrotherlyhate** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Cheating is obviously wrong but everyone has terrible and heartbreaking stuff happen to them (including sometimes cheating) and only a minuscule amount of people are so unable to handle these trials that they turn to one of the most selfish methods of coping, suicide. I'm willing to bet that in most cases where suicide comes as a result of problems that the person can't control, there's probably previous mental problems (or sometimes physical problems) that the person has been dealing with. To totally blame a cheating spouse for a person's suicide seems short sighted to me

          ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 30): Canada. 80-84 = A- / 85-89 = A / 90+ = A+

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 9): Ye then that A- is more equivalent to a B+ or a B in systems where there's no A+.

Not a bad grade by any means, just looks better than it is when you're used to A- being really close to perfect.

              ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 7): Not necessarily though, because while the US system is designed in such a way that getting an A is possible through hard work, other countries have systems where getting the equivalent is simply not really a realistic goal. The tests are designed so that effectively everyone makes mistakes, getting even 90 percent right can mean that you are good at the subject, smart in general, and working very hard - anything less and lower grades are usual. I don't know if it's the case in Canada as well, but I think it's possible that that is why they changed the numbers for the letter grades.

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 8): At LSE in London I remember something like a 60% was an A lol. The tests were much harder though..

                    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

                      ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 2): Really? Where I live getting 90-93 is considered an A- and 80-84 would be a D+ (assuming A+ to D- scale). Our 75 is an F ):

              ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's rough. F here is anything under 50. With 50s being Ds, 60s Cs, 70s Bs, and 80+ As.

          ↳ **xLaZi3x** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 2): A good bit of Universities do a 10 point system especially technical or STEM schools. 

Never heard of an 80 being an A tho, would be a B(B-) most places I know of

Read the Canadian reply: That's interesting

            ↳ **ScumlordAzazel** 回复 xLaZi3x (👍 1): The grading scale at my university was different depending on the subject. Most were 10 or but basic engineering courses were 93 and up as an A and the really hard 0hysics classes had like 85 and up as an A.

I also know Canada secondary schools have different grading scales depending on the province. Can't remember what it was for post-secondary schools because I was only calculating US equivalent GPAs at my last job for secondary schools. India has grading scales where you pass so long as it's above a 34. 34 to 44 would be a D.

Also, most US high schools use the 10 pt scale.

In my high school, we had this one math teacher who was absolutely drop dead gorgeous. She fucked another math teacher for a while and ended up getting pregnant. She might've been able to convince her husband that it was his child except that he had gotten a complete vasectomy a few years prior to this. 

People need to stop marrying people that they don't want to be with forever and this will be less common.

He isn't doomed to lifelong idiocy; he can crawl out of the hole he's in, if he wishes to, but as of right now, he hasn't, and therefore, by definition, is an idiot. Sorry, but facts are facts.

              ↳ **LastCommander086** 回复 listenupsmartass (👍 3): So, in your world, he is an idiot because he is a beginner?

Don't sell these as facts. They are not. They're your opinion, and nothing more.

> I do speak a second language

It's so cute watching you brag while you only speak 2.... Because I speak 4 languages, motherfucker. If you want to count my shitty Norwegian, I speak 5. I'm telling you this because by your logic I can declare you are also an idiot just because you know less than me.

Get over it. No one is an idiot because they're a beginner. If anything, being a beginner should be celebrated, because you're willing to learn something new.

> I don't see what's wrong calling a spade a spade.

Well, then you are a lost cause!

                ↳ **listenupsmartass** 回复 LastCommander086 (👍 1): Bragging? You presumed that I wasn't bilingual, and I simply refuted your shitty hypothesis. If anyone here's bragging, it would be you, but that's not the point. 

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

    ↳ **Aliensinnoh** 回复 jcutta (👍 34): Class moms work if you live in a relatively privileged area. Though parents fundraising can easily morph into a district underfunding all schools and only the rich neighborhoods get fundraising. Ultimately in the US funding needs to be moved to the state level to break the back of unequal schooling.

      ↳ **jcutta** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 18): Oh yeah, it's absolutely a mark of a privileged area. My town is considered poor compared to the town we border but we're definitely upper middle, median home price is somewhere close to $400k, and median income is something like $175k household.

I think state funding would be great, but I want to see the poorer areas be increased and the more well off areas stay steady. I pay a shit load of taxes to have my kids well educated and I don't want them to be handicapped to meet some arbitrary common ground. Bring everyone up to the higher standards rather than lower the standards across the board. I also think teaching should be a 6 figure job not $50-60k or much less depending on district.

      ↳ **TragedyPornFamilyVid** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 3): Yup.  My hometown has fabulous schools, funded through property tax.

The state redirects some of the funds to support impoverished districts, but the end result is a school that's 80 to 90 % kids from 6-figure households in a low cost of living state and kids from the one apartment complex that aims to rent to illegal immigrants, because they're easier to extort and steal from.

People resist equalizing funding, because most of the people in the high quality school districts moved there for the schools.  You have families that could afford to have a nice house and short commute in a different suburb with shitty schools or a nasty 2 bedroom apartment with a predatory landlord in a district where every teacher has a master's degree and a good portion have their Ph.d.

They're going to see it as selfish behavior by the people who chose to put building equity over their kids' education and now want the benefits of both without voting to raise their own taxes to fund it.

        ↳ **Aliensinnoh** 回复 TragedyPornFamilyVid (👍 3): Part of it is presumably schools funded at the state level would be funded through income taxes rather than property taxes. So suddenly all the towns spending half their budget on schools will be able to slash their property taxes while the state raises income taxes on everyone.

          ↳ **jcutta** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 2): Someone could hand NJ enough money to fund schools for the rest of time and they still would raise property taxes every year.

          ↳ **TragedyPornFamilyVid** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 1): Texas doesn't have an income tax.

Everything is funded through property tax or sales tax. As a result, they passed the "Robinhood act" to redistribute funds to poorer school districts.

For example,  between 2014 and 2018 Austin ISD increased taxes collected for education from about $700 million to almost $1200 million, but the budget for their school district remained stagnant.

The local residents could vote to double their taxes again, but they wouldn't be able to give their local schools any additional funds.  Those would be recaptured by the state. More than half of Austin ISD's students are "economically disadvantaged" and about quarter need ESL classes, but the land is valuable, so the district has to give money away to district with lower property values.

It's made them the icon of people who oppose that law, but the truth is that the state is obligated to provide an education to everyone.  If people don't want an income tax, this is the alternative.

Yet we can afford a bailout that could have given every US citizen 13,000 dollars. 

This country is a fucking shithole.

  ↳ **TheScumAlsoRises** 回复 hungryhograt (👍 2): >I have to fund it ... it’s just very fortunate that my wife is also a teacher so she’s understanding 

First half of this sentence I thought you were going to say you’re fortunate because your wife has a job that pays well, so you’re fortunate to have at least one spouse with a decent salary so you’re able to afford funding those things for your students. 

Both inspiring and sad to read the second half of the sentence where you say you’re fortunate not because you have the money to easily fund and pay for these things, but your equally underpaid wife is simply understAnding of how important it is for the kids. You’re fortunate because you’re both good people in the same underpaid, leaky boat.

You sound like great, dedicated teachers and mentors. Wish you all the best.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 hungryhograt (👍 1): I feel like you could definitely do something super cheap for Halloween, like kids of course bring own costumes, have them use construction paper to make little bags or decorate, then have $20 big bag of candy to play with - $20 total there.

    ↳ **hungryhograt** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): I usually get an assortment of sweets, I bring drinks and snacks, sometimes we make things, sometimes we just watch a movie (it all depends on the class and what they choose to do collectively). Kids are encouraged to bring things to share but it’s not compulsory. The problem comes in with having 6-7 different classes (depending on the day). But I justify spending the money by telling myself that it’s only once a year and it’s a lot of fun for the kids

This was a long time ago (hopefully this kind of behavior is no longer tolerated in schools) and I'm sure the guy was dealing with a lot of personal issues of one kind or another.

I even had nights where there was a student sleeping on my couch because they got kicked out.

I even bailed a few students out of jail or been their "parent" in hospitals because their parent wouldn't accept the responsibility of parenting.

I have about 12 children that I all love dearly. As their only parent I made sure they got into a good college with a cushy scholarship. I know they can be the best they can be when they have to tools they need.

They all keep in contact with me. Some already graduated and are settling down and starting a family which makes me feel old.

He even lived with one of his teachers in their guest room because he "needed discipline" and had no respect for our parents. He did whatever that dude told him to, but cussed at our actual parents if they asked him to put in an effort. Ugh, gross. I was glad when he wasn't in our house lol

There was another kid in my class who was genuinely a very good artist, certainly put me to shame and he always got an A, and deserved that A.  And there was one other kid who couldn’t care less about art and always got a D.

One morning before art class we three decided to do an experiment.  Those two other kids swapped homework and signed each other’s.

Sure enough, the talented kid still got an A and the other kid still got a D.  None of tried after that, if the teacher didn’t care why should we?  It killed my passion for art.

Pretty sure the teacher probably just found out what y'all did and graded y'all for the work you actually did. If y'all had been in the class doing assignments for that long it probably wasn't hard to figure out. 

But I feel ya, I had an art teacher when I was in 2nd grade erase a self portrait I'd done while standing overtop of me telling me how I'd done it all "wrong". Killed my passion for drawing at a young age.

        ↳ **LethalSalad** 回复 DTSportsNow (👍 4): That'd be pretty bad teaching if they wouldn't even have mentioned it to the kids. The only thing they'd do is make the kids think they didn't actually check it. (Which, according to OP, was exactly what happened)

        ↳ **Rokurokubi83** 回复 DTSportsNow (👍 3): Maybe you’re right, he never struck us as being particularly interested or passionate though, just going through the motions. Obviously I’ll never really know but the damage was done for me.  Maybe I’ll pick art up again some day and see if I can rekindle something.

          ↳ **KeepCalm-ShutUp** 回复 Rokurokubi83 (👍 3): My philosophy for art has always been "I don't know what I'm doing, I don't care whether or not it's right, I care even less what you think of it (but praise is appreciated), this is still good enough for me."

Maybe that'll rekindle your interest, but I doubt it.

      ↳ **Shanakitty** 回复 Rokurokubi83 (👍 6): I get the frustration. I had an art teacher one year who gave me an 87 on every single assignment I turned in. But I mean, if they'd been teaching you guys for a couple of years, they probably knew what your drawing styles looked like.

      ↳ **AsherGray** 回复 Pete_Booty_Judge (👍 1): It's kind of crazy how English doesn't have an ambiguous, singular, possessive reference. Obviously, Americans have started using they/them/theirs as the inclusive reference, but technically only applicable to multiple people over one individual.

        ↳ **Pete_Booty_Judge** 回复 AsherGray (👍 1): Take this with a huge grain of salt that I know only a very entry level bit of Spanish and French, but my experience with those languages at least is that their singular, possessive references really aren’t that ambiguous as they are still gendered.  

I’m more than ok with American English (I can’t speak to what other English speaking countries are doing) using plural pronouns to maintain ambiguity, as I think the context is even easier to spot in many cases as to whether or not you’re talking about a singular entity or a plural one, compared to figuring out whether or not “il” or “el” is gendered or ambiguous.  

I do think that English speakers should be more forgiving towards ESL speakers as I do honestly believe our language is a very difficult one to master and I have great respect for anyone that has bothered to learn it better than my own feeble attempts at foreign languages.

"You" used to be exclusively plural as well, in early modern English and before.  Language changed as "thee" and "thou" fell out of favor and a singular second person pronoun was needed to fill the old words' place.

Languages change.  What we teach in school is a general "best practice" but even then much of the language stuff will change with dialect and time.

i give up.  you have exhausted me.

  ↳ **JabbaTheMutten** 回复 angerylittlehoovy (👍 0): Actually, "their" is supposed to be a plural pronoun. So, since OP is referring to a single teacher, "it" is technically correct if you don't want to use "he" or "she"

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 JabbaTheMutten (👍 4): [deleted]

      ↳ **MilledGears** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I know in highschool English class we were thought that although using "they" is nicer when referring to someone of unspecified gender, using "it" is grammatically correct.

It is worth noting this was over a decade ago and language changes with time. When I was taught this gender was still considered interchangeable with sex and gender identity wasn't a prevalent topic.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MilledGears (👍 3): [deleted]

          ↳ **MilledGears** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I guess so, we were also taught to refer to animals by "it", if "it" is only meant for inanimate things I figure referring to animals with "it" would be wrong.

  ↳ **DueMaternal** 回复 angerylittlehoovy (👍 1): It's a joke because the teacher is not supposed to be a persn.

**[deleted]** (👍 6936): I can soooo relate. It's the only job, I guess, where you steal supplies from home and bring them to work.


Edit. 
Ok, ok, what is happening!? I'm going to read every single post here, I promise. I'm overwhelmed!
I want to thank the Academy... wait, wrong.

My wife teaches, does that count? Also, I mad respect you all right now. I have always respected and supported teachers, but even more so now that you guys have to put up with all this mess.

Except you aren't given the recipe, the kitchen is on fire, and you're expected to make them perfect without any help from the recipe-makers.

      ↳ **tubelesssquid88** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): When being a teacher tho they dont do it for the money, they do it to be with kids and help them learn and teach.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 tubelesssquid88 (👍 4): No, we also have to do it for the money. We owe it to our own families and ourselves. But the truth is that this job requires to see students as humans and to like them. Well, ideally. There are also dickish  teachers, unfortunately.

          ↳ **tubelesssquid88** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Yeah I've had them before. But I feel and this is my opinion from an ith grader, that teachers are WAAAY underplayed. Honestly I believe you deserve more money than what you make

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 tubelesssquid88 (👍 4): Thanks! Well, being underappreciated can kill the teacher spark. And the kids deserve to have teachers who are actually content with their career choice.

As for the money, I agree, my wallet agrees, too. Luckily, I live in a relatively inexpensive country and a small town. So it's not that bad.

    ↳ **totential_rigger** 回复 EMRBRT (👍 93): Tbf I was a teacher since I was 23 (I'm 27 now but no longer teach) and I'm well versed in meme culture. I had more in common with the students than my colleagues lol

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 totential_rigger (👍 21): I know that feeling.  On the verge of 40 years old and have more in common with the new teacher than my colleagues my own age.  I have to pretend I don't know things just for the sake of saving face.

So this online instruction... easy peasy.  Not for others around my age.

        ↳ **pinacoladablackbird** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Same! Although I fear that the kids think I'm just desperately trying to be cool and relatable when I talk about memes and games etc. when it's just my lack of maturity at the grand age of 32.

  ↳ **Embarrassed-Culture1** 回复 [deleted] (👍 6): Same with some custodians, I used to bring tools, electrical tape, and fresh microfiber cloths since we were always short on that stuff. Never brought germicide or pesticide or other chemicals because there's laws behind that kind of stuff. Sometimes we'd go hunting with the principal and bring back a bunch of hog meat to make some pulled pork or stew for the teachers. I miss those days.

  ↳ **AuspiciousAnteater** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): I'm assuming no, but could you tally those items up and submit a compensation report?

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AuspiciousAnteater (👍 2): Sometimes it is possible, but the budget is so tight that you generally have to choose between doing something at your own expense or not doing it at all. I teach English as a foreign language and, believe you me, there's no price I wouldn't pay to see a bunch of 18-year-olds play shop for 45 minutes. (I printed out the money, bought stickers, school supplies, fruit, what not, and they spent the whole class taking turns at the check out and practising shopping dialogues. It was fun. At some point I was not necessary in the classroom almost, they took the role play into their own hands).

  ↳ **ylcard** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Office jobs as well, yes technically your employer might provide you with everything that you need, but it's going to be the cheapest shit you can think of, sometimes cheap shit is uncomfortable to use, like say headphones, so you bring your wh-1000xm3 to work.. because you want to be comfortable while working

Or coffee mugs and actual coffee, much better to have your own because you can control the higiene of it and the quality (of the coffee)

Replying to this top-rated comment for visibility, because it's important.  

https://www.classroomgiving.org  

Pick a teacher in your state/town (or anywhere if you like), buy supplies off their Amazon wish list, ship directly to their classroom. It rocks. What would rock more is if states and communities funded their schools a lot better, but this'll have to do in the meantime.

  ↳ **SathedIT** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Can we donate supplies to your classroom somehow? My kids have been lucky enough to be in a charter school that has tons of resources for teachers and students. I know that most schools, teachers, and students aren't that lucky, so I'd like to help any way I can.

  ↳ **mrbeermonkey** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): My girlfriend is a teacher and she does this all the time and it’s the sweetest thing. I often tell her to bill the school, or ask them to buy the stuff for the kids, but she never does. Buys every kid in her class a book at the end of every year and writes a personalised note in each one. She is the loveliest person I know.

Only on reddit do people see a teacher talk about their experiences of having to pay for their own supplies to fund their classroom and their response is to buy awards and put money into the deep pockets of reddit instead of to a teachers charity, this teacher's personal funds, or literally anything to do with teaching or education.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Burt__Macklin__FBI2 (👍 1): Oh, come on. I know it's not practical. But I guess I needed that appreciation. There's a saying, not a very common one, but it fits. An appreciated teacher doesn't bark at their students.

Edit.  Pronoun.

      ↳ **Burt__Macklin__FBI2** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Oh, feel appreciated. It's not directed at you, or your enjoyment out of it. That's cool. 

I'm just saying for people willing to throw cash around after your post could find a lot better and meaningful ways to spend it (educational charities, etc) versus sticking it in the pocket of lifelong loser, Steve Huffman reddit CEO

This year, I've already spent $300 on cleaning supplies. The struggle is real! 

Office supplies do not last long in my house lol I bring them to work right away.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 uhohoreolas (👍 2): Yeah, painting rooms, decorating them, school supplies, access to educational websites, some prizes, private unpaid time at the weekend (apart from tests and class preparation), training courses ( I'm required by law to advance and train). Aaaaall that jazz;) 
Teachers of this world are united by one more thing!

  ↳ **QueenRhaenys** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): And the only job where you get three months off in the summer, two weeks at Christmas, and literally every federal holiday. That adds up. I get 2 weeks total so I have to spend vacation days at Christmas

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 QueenRhaenys (👍 1): I don't get that much off. 6 weeks over the summer, 2 weeks in winter, a week at christmas, a week at easter. Still more than most people, what can I say, I love this time off,  It would be lovely though if I could take a day off during the school year for dental emergencies, doctor visits, etc. I don't need so much time off in the summr, id rather work as usual. It's the students that do.

      ↳ **QueenRhaenys** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Oh ok. You must not work at a US public school. I just assumed, sorry. Every public school in the US lets out in mid May or mid June (depending on where in the country). If mid May, they go back in mid August. If mid June, sometime around Labor Day. 

Still, I would love to have six straight weeks in a row off. I work at a nonprofit and am also “underpaid”...in fact I probably get paid less than most teachers and work 30% more but that is my choice.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 QueenRhaenys (👍 3): That's ok. I've got to tell you that those 6 weeks are both a blessing and a curse. It takes me two weeks to unwind, because the end of the school year is mad with paperwork. And suddenly, with the last day of school,  there's nothing I have to do. It's like running around headless, no rhyme or reason. But at some point I can really rest. And I have no problem with my own kids in the summer.

          ↳ **QueenRhaenys** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That’s nice! I can see it being a blessing and a curse

But I feel like being a teacher is seen as a comfy job where you do nothing. Well, wrong. You carry the workload, the emotional load, yours and that of others.   Have you ever tried doing it? What's your experience?

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -39): [deleted]

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 16): We're probably too sensitive, I guess. And you're right that teachers tend to tell people how hard they work. Idk, in the jobs that I did before becoming a teacher, no one told me to my face that my job is idk too easy, or my profession is for lazy people. I've been told numerous times that teachers earn too much for the job they do. I find it difficult to digest and maybe become defensive because I live my job, I get totally immersed in it, you know, with zeal. And seeing disbelief when somebody asks me what I'm doing at 8 pm and I say I'm working is a little unnerving.

But, well, what can you do. I still love it. I know there are teachers who are dumbasses, lazy gits or idiots. And I'm trying to do my job best I can.

**[deleted]** (👍 133): Reminds me of a party me and my class threw for our favourite English teachers birthday a few years ago, we went and bought cake, party poppers and a birthday card that we all wrote out names on wishing him a happy birthday.

About 30 min before the class started we asked another teacher to unlock the classroom and we set up in there, 5 minutes before class started he unlocked the door and we all yelled happy birthday!

He was really happy and instead of doing the actual things he had planned we all ate our cake and played different party games together, it was our last year at that school so we wanted to make it a bit special for him.

Still my best memory from that school.

        ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 agent_raconteur (👍 1): Well I do wish there was a distinct word, because I hate the idea of using the same word to refer to a group of people and one person without gender specified. It seems like a real flaw in the English language, but it works for now and it is more personable than "it".

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 agent_raconteur (👍 1): [removed]

          ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 [deleted] (👍 4): people are revolting against using “they” as a single pronoun to refer to one person. they think that it’s impractical, but everyone uses it in their daily language anyway lol

            ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): Yeah I saw Oxford or somebody added the singular they to the dictionary last year and was [like](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/710/dd0.png), haven't we been doing that the whole time?

              ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): we have been! but a lot of transphobic people were like “wahhh it’s not in the dictionary that means it doesn’t exist” so oxford added it in iirc

                ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): SOO many older people I know are hung up on thinking that language is derived from the dictionary instead of the other way around. Probably what they were taught in school 50 years ago so a hard mental construct to break. 

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

                  ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): the definition of -phobia is a fear *or aversion* and yet it’s so ignored lol

                    ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

      ↳ **holdingmytongue** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): This also is why I’ll never be comfortable calling someone ‘it’, even if it is their chosen pronoun.  Gender neutral terminology aside-‘it’ sounds so inhuman and derogatory. 
I will do whatever mental gymnastics is required to avoid calling you that.

  ↳ **vne2000** 回复 DouchNozzle_REAL (👍 4): It buys the pizza or it gets the hose

  ↳ **OsStrohsAndBohs** 回复 DouchNozzle_REAL (👍 5): Could have at least used proper grammar to call the teacher an it

  ↳ **Schmich** 回复 DouchNozzle_REAL (👍 4): Even if the teacher is a robot it's wrong: its vs it's.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 DouchNozzle_REAL (👍 6): [removed]

    ↳ **DouchNozzle_REAL** 回复 [deleted] (👍 9): Yes but the more appropriate term would be "their".


If I were to call a person an "it" I'm almost referring to them as property or as an object. The usage of "it" is dehumanizing. 



"It" is more acceptable when you say something like "it's a boy!" Or "it's me!".

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 DouchNozzle_REAL (👍 1): Actually, "his/her" is gramatically correct, as weird as it may sound. Their suggests a plural possesive, and op is refering to a singular person

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): No, English has used "their" as a gender neutral singular forever. The idea that it this isn't proper English is a lot like the "split infinitives" rule or "never end with a preposition" rule. In that you hear people claim it is a rule but it's not actually a rule of standard English.

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Then why did i learn it in english class my nib

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Because there are a lot of “traditionalists” who learned those so-called rules and then also teach them. And there are also a certain group of language prescriptivists who think they ought to be considered formal rules.

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): http://www.kentlaw.edu/academics/lrw/grinker/LwtaGender_Neutral_Language.htm#:~:text=Do%20not%20use%20"their"%20as,of%20avoiding%20gender-based%20language.

"Do not use "their" as an alternative to his or her; "their" should be used only when referring to a plural subject. Each of the rules here offers a method of avoiding gender-based language."

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

                    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

        ↳ **DouchNozzle_REAL** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): While you're correct, in this day and age using "his/her" isn't as socially acceptable when *we don't know the gender of the person we are referring to*.

I couldn’t tell you how much money I’ve spent just doing art projects with the kids because my coteacher used up all of the materials money without saving any for me. But damn if those kids don’t have amazing art projects every week and they have a fun time making them

Incredibly hard at times; massively stressful, and you often feel like you've put blood, sweat, and tears in that just go completely unappreciated (by kids and senior leaders) but I love it and wouldn't want to do anything else. I always felt like if I could make a difference to one kid, this whole life would be worth it. 10 years on, I really believe that I've done that, and so many of the kids are just fantastic human beings. Many are also little shits but they don't tend to be in any great numbers!

**curiousAnsh** (👍 11): There is a quote from an ancient Indian philosopher/teacher/statesman which goes like-"A teacher is never an ordinary person (because) powers of both creation and destruction plays in his lap". Meaning a teacher literally lays foundation of what  values future generations of a society will carry.

**[deleted]** (👍 12): Did you just call a teacher "it"?

**[deleted]** (👍 17): Any particular reason you referred to the teacher as an "it?"

  ↳ **jwse30** 回复 [deleted] (👍 25): I would guess that the author’s native language is not English, and used “it” as a pronoun for something that could be either gender.

**TheGuyWhoLikesMemes** (👍 4): My teacher always does a good job teaching us so everytime theres a class party i bring 2 2l cokes and 2 big pizzas to celebrate

**NateTheMetalhead** (👍 5): Some teachers really don't care, and when you're just a kid trying to make it to the next day, it can take a toll. But there's always a handful of them that really do, and they will leave a lifelong impression on you. I still remember the names of the ones that went the extra mile for me despite not having spoken to any of them in over 10 years. I hope they're doing well

After some years I realized that she bought all of those things with her own hard made money. In my country, teachers have really small salary, and from she did all those things from the goodness of her heart. Teachers really deserve more.

**[deleted]** (👍 3): It?

**Bannanapieguy** (👍 3): I remember one of my teachers always tried doing stuff like this but the school never actually went through with it. I feel so bad looking back because of course all the kids put the blame on the teacher not the school.

**craterinvader** (👍 3): I had a high school teacher who wanted to argue. It made her happy.  I was one of her only students who would get up and scream about how she was wrong. I thought she really hated me. But she gave me a hug on the last day of High school and said she was going to miss arguing with me.

**crap_its_ants** (👍 3): Ok so I have a similar story. The principal at the middle school I go to said that he would give five or so students a pizza after they helped him sort through a bucket full a notes, this said pizza was never bought even weeks after this event had happened.

Their pension and benefits are really good. Pay is average for the difficulty of the degree and the job

  ↳ **MamaBear_07** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): A preschool teacher gets paid less than any other teacher here in the US. Yet they say Early Childhood Education is most important for children learning and growing. I get paid $21 here in the Bay Area but we are moving to Phoenix and I’ll be lucky to get $13. We deal with so much yet get paid nothing

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MamaBear_07 (👍 1): Not to sound insulting but my preschool years consisted of games, recess, naptime and not much learning. It makes sense to me theyre paid the lowest as it requires the least amount of training/schooling

      ↳ **MamaBear_07** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Not insulting at all. I am in the bay area and I work in a school that has 90% tech parents so they expect a lot more than games and recess. All we do is learning there. I actually feel bad for the kids because they don’t get much play and if they get any of their paperwork wrong parents come to me asking why. And if you have a bachelors in early childhood education You get the same amount of education as elementary teachers do. I am overqualified for my position. And the thing that makes me laugh the most is a lot of preschool teacher positions in the Phoenix area require a bachelors degrees yet they only want to pay $13 an hour

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MamaBear_07 (👍 2): Damn that is quite a difference for sure. I can see why you feel that way

  ↳ **Pruwee** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I'm in the Philippines and I can confirm we are underpaid even after years of service - that's why a lot of teachers here really set their eyes on teaching abroad.

**[deleted]** (👍 5): teachers only work 180 days a year right? doesn’t the average person work like 100 more days? 40k for half of the year doesn’t sound too bad. 

i think the system needs reform in that the school year should be extended and high school should end at 10th grade. That way we can pay teachers more (since they’ll work more) and they don’t have to get second jobs

  ↳ **mdahms95** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Go by year round school, work three months, take a month off. It still works out and students have a breathing buffer and could possibly boost productivity

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 mdahms95 (👍 1): sure. my point is that there are a number of solutions. i have nothing against teachers and would like to see them do better, but i do think it’s disingenuous to say they’re underpaid when the average 4 year graduate job works 100 more days and gets marginally more than they do

**Aus_The_B0ss** (👍 2): Y'all are lucky! Everything about our class party (decorations, food, cake, lighting, music system) is arranged by the students' money and students have do most of the work. Moreover, authority gains a lot of unethical profit from it -_-

**freekingTerraria** (👍 2): In canada tho teachers are over paid and protested for a even better wage. I think there wage is something like 80 000

Everyone was used to the company buying gifts every year prior, so they freaked out that the manager gave them something so cheap. What they didn’t realize is the company didn’t pay for anything and they manager actually went out of her way to make sure folks still got something by spending money out of her own pocket.

**winterfoxxxx** (👍 2): Idk where all these teachers work but my partner earns a decent amount as a teacher, and can claim nearly any resource she uses for teaching on tax as a work expense. So either y'all teachers didn't like you very much or teachers pay sucks in other countries.

**camsean** (👍 2): Teachers are pretty well paid in Australia.

**sloppymcgee** (👍 2): maybe slices are small bc kids are fat

**gayfroggs** (👍 2): One year when I was 12 we had a class party and from past experience we knew that they weren't going to be very much food to go around the whole class so me and my friend bought a load of pizza making supplies and made this massive pizza that managed  to get around the entire class plus some of the teachers aswell

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 gayfroggs (👍 1): How did u do that did u make pizza in the school oven at the cafeteria or what or did u make it at home and bring to school heat it up in microwave or oven at cafeteria how?

    ↳ **gayfroggs** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I made it at home then cooked it at school, I just made sure to put it in a air tight tub and put it in the refrigerator

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 gayfroggs (👍 1): Ahh I see

**TheNowhereMan418** (👍 2): In my school, the teachers all got a raise because of this reason. But one teacher was fired because she rugby tackled a kid for wearing his jumper around his waist.

**fufuberry21** (👍 2): You could at least give the teacher a human pronoun.

**Rae-O-Sunshinee** (👍 2): My mom was a 6th grade teacher (I also volunteered when I was old enough) and she bought 2 pizzas and those brats were so ungrateful lol. All they did was complain about only having 1 slice and even said that it was a waste of time. My mother picked out her few good students, gave them 2 slices, and told me to pack the rest of it and drive home with it xD. They were so mad but it was so funny to watch it all unfold.

  ↳ **Its_Mavis** 回复 Rae-O-Sunshinee (👍 1): that is great

**p_cool_guy** (👍 2): Oh god. Are...all of the parties paid for by the teacher? I could have sworn when I was younger I had to ask my parents to chip in for it. Maybe they were just asking for help because I doubt they wouldn't have let any kid who didn't have money have a slice.

**mr-ur-dad** (👍 2): Can’t relate , we hype the teachers our selves and buy some good shit with our own money that everyone has to bring (or someone pays instead of em) then we just bust a class we three giant pizzas and bring the teacher somethin too so they don’t tell anyone

**[deleted]** (👍 2): Gotta love being so afraid to gender someone that you call a human being an “It” instead.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): The same pronoun they used for the pizza. Wow glad they gave him/her the respect of not assuming a gender and put him/her on the level of pizza

**_joebro** (👍 2): So we just not gonna talk about the it

**keep-purr** (👍 2): Teachers I know have it real good money wise. Work for 9 months, included premium health insurance, wracking up a HUGE pension. Teachers do have it pretty good. However they say there are a lot of them who are always wanting more money. 

Props to teachers like this anyways, this means they are trying and likely succeeding.

**BananaGuy71** (👍 2): This happened to me, but then the teacher took away the party because one day (a week before the party) we had a sub and an angry teacher got mad at us for doing nothing and tattled on us so we didn’t get the party.

**ReformedYordle** (👍 2): To all such teachers out there, trying their best - THANK YOU!

**BIG_BRAIN69420** (👍 2): Y'all have such great teachers, my teacher shouts at me if I drop a pencil, only primary school teachers are good

  ↳ **Kamica** 回复 BIG_BRAIN69420 (👍 2): It really can be a mixed bag. A lot of people become teachers for different reasons, and unfortunately not all of them for good reasons :/.

And a lot of teachers work off the "I'm an authority figure, you should respect me and do exactly what I say, no matter your personal circumstances" model of thought, rather than the "What works for my students?" Model.

**SixionZ** (👍 2): Are we gonna ignore that the meme refers to the teacher as an it lol

**The_Real_Raw_Gary** (👍 2): My home school teacher tried to do this for me and my classmates. Couldn’t even afford napkins so I had to eat naked so I didn’t get my clothes messy. 

I dunno why they chose to take class pics that day either. High school blows amirite?

**overmediumeggs** (👍 2): In middle school our gym teacher brought in bite-size candy bars as rewards for winning different races. A kid complained about how small they were and she snapped about how she was living out of her car and used some of her first paycheck from the school to bring in candy for us. From that day forward, whenever teachers brought us anything, I always made sure they knew how appreciative I was.

  ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 overmediumeggs (👍 1): I don’t think that’s true, I’m not quite sure about a gym teacher but the average teacher salary is 60,000 so that’s either BS or your teacher is garbage with finance.

    ↳ **overmediumeggs** 回复 chainsawtony99 (👍 1): She was fresh out of being a student teacher and I am from a very small rural town in upstate NY. So, it was likely true.

      ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 overmediumeggs (👍 2): Ok yea that makes more sense, I didn’t consider that. Hopefully she makes more now.

**SansyBoy14** (👍 2): In band we had a pizza party, we each had to bring 5 bucks and we each got a full pizza. That was amazing

**Thepelicanstate** (👍 2): As an elementary teacher one of my students said: 

“Mr. W, why do we always do nachos and cheese for parties?” 

Me: Because I can just keep adding water and stretching it to feed as many of you as I can.

Or when a parent complained one time about me asking for a dollar to bring in and help cover supplies but she drove up in a Mercedes. 

Her: my taxes pay your salary, so I’ve already given you a dollar. 

Me: ma’am, due to local taxes and millages, your overall contribution is really about $15 for every $100,000 your home is worth. So taking the $45 you might give, divided amongst 800 teachers in the district, I’m not really seeing your single impact on my check. 

I did get in trouble for this.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Thepelicanstate (👍 2): Why did u get in trouble u told the truth it’s like the meme where the black guy says why are you booing me I’m RIGHT!

**Speachlessmoose** (👍 2): My teacher did the best she could when it came to pizza and stuff. It’s sad to see a lot of teachers put in a lot of effort and must people don’t even realize it

**Ruby5000** (👍 2): That’s the “donate it to charity” slice

**LatkaGravas** (👍 2): https://www.classroomgiving.org  

Pick a teacher in your state/town (or anywhere if you like), buy supplies off their Amazon wish list, ship directly to their classroom.  It rocks.  What would rock more is if states and communities funded their schools a lot better, but this'll have to do in the meantime.

**PaperLady90** (👍 2): My 2nd grade teacher made a rather large activity packet for us to do over the summer. It was like getting three months of homework in one lump sum. Any student who completed the whole thing by the end of the summer break was rewarded with a lunch party at Friendly’s. I didn’t fully appreciate it back then, but holy crap was that an amazing thing for an elementary school teacher to do! She wasn’t even our assigned teacher anymore and the work wasn’t for any sort of credit for us OR paycheck for her. She was only trying to keep our minds engaged while we were away from the classroom. If I remember correctly, only about 7 (+/-) of us completed the packet, but that STILL must have been a hefty Friendly’s bill. All for the love of teaching. Bless you, Miss Rusnak!

**Erudes11** (👍 2): When I was in senior highschool our "class adviser" (I don't know what they're called in other countries, but she's the one handling our whole class affairs) always bring a big ass pot with hot soups/"champorado"(hot chocolate with sticky rice) every morning for us to have a breakfast before class because she noticed that most of us are so sleepy and have low energy every morning. She did it for most of our school year. Knowing how big the pot is she probably wakes up around 4am-5am to prepare it (our classes starts at 7:30) and spend her own money every day to buy the ingredients for it. She refuses to take our contributions for it as well. Best teacher I ever had, literally like having a second mom.

**yeet-master9** (👍 2): Also what about the hallway floors those always have some weird pattern

**persimmon40** (👍 2): It's weird that in US most jobs are paid more than comparable jobs in Canada, but not for teachers for some reason.

**C0nardoesReddit** (👍 2): Hey, It’s free food, now that I’m in college I’ve learned to appreciate free food wherever I can get it. When quarantine is lifted and COVID is minimal, I’ll be going to any event on campus and off that serves free food.

**Laetiporus1** (👍 2): I’ve always emailed the teacher hosting the pizza party if the need money, drinks, plates. help with picking up or paying for pizza. They usually decline. I wish teachers would ask for help or money more.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): That’s a lot of awards mate

**tinytuffytiger** (👍 2): Had to scroll back to comment. I used to shop with my mom, a now retired school teacher, for boys boxers, girls panties, slips, socks for all. Basics. Then every year we did a coat drive, begging people to give us old coats they no longer use.

**Crazed_God** (👍 2): This post has a teacher's salary worth of awards

**[deleted]** (👍 2): My middleschool teacher held an aircraft club after school, he bought us miniature models with his own money and took us to the local pilot school for a field trip, you guessed it, with his own money. Also took us to mcdonalds after, we need more teachers like him. 

Just wanna add that there were only 6kids in the club but still it was HIS money he didn't have to use

Jokes aside dude for serious teachers can be dicks yes, but they are some of the first people to shape the minds of generations to come, and should be more respected and loved. 

PAY TEACHERS BETTER WAGES

**tellytubyowo17** (👍 2): "IT'S"

**Super_Fightin_Robot** (👍 2): Anyone else think the "it's" in this meme is really weird? I feel like it should be replaced with "their".

**robxburninator** (👍 2): Honestly when I saw this yesterday I got so sad.  Next year I'll keep the pizza for myself :(

**oojiflip** (👍 2): "it's" lmaoooo

**Cyanomelas** (👍 2): Teachers buy a lot of shit with their own money for their classes.  It's criminal how underfunded most schools in the US are.

**TheGreatBeaver123789** (👍 2): Rip this guys inbox

**akatherder** (👍 2): We won some contest that Domino's held at our school.  I think it was a rip-off of Pizza Hut's Book-it and we read the most books or something.  They gave us 4 large pizzas so 40 pieces of pizza for 30 kids.  My teacher made the best of it and cut the 4th pizza's slices into thirds with his swiss army knife.

You can't complain about free pizza but kids didn't bring lunch and 1.333 slices of pizza is kinda weak...

**fluffuanyurpants** (👍 2): Teachers r really underpaid

**an_orignal_name** (👍 2): Since when are teachers it?

**[deleted]** (👍 2): My wife has spent countless hours baking for her students because they did something great or, in some cases, simply to show them she loves them. 150  students. Every year and sometimes twice a year. We have a separate savings account for this now. We put away whatever money we can so she has the funds to do this.

**Trotrock** (👍 2): To be honest those thin slices of pizza always hit different, more flavor and felt more deserving. Miss those days, now the only reward for doing good is knowing that i have a 3.8+ GPA

**pZ_Dorsal** (👍 2): It’s own money? ITS???

**chubbyxavi** (👍 2): Im not crying! You are!

**ThatGuyAllen** (👍 2): And yet you called the teacher an "it"

**[deleted]** (👍 2): As a former teacher..... I am reminded again why I had to quit my job. I made so little money, I had huge student loan debt, and the little money I wanted to save, I was spending on my classes.... I had to get out. I miss teaching but not the lifestyle it brings

**dbattag3** (👍 2): I literally did this while making less than minimum wage at a pizza shop. Buying a couple pizzas for your students isn’t enough to complain about😂
Teachers get paid more than most people in the work force plus they get the summers off to work somewhere else! Sick of all the whiners in reddit!

**tiptoeintotown** (👍 2): I totally had my middle school students dog me one year because I gave them ALL a holiday pizza/movie party and since I had to pay for it myself, it was Little Caesar’s 😂

**RobotWizard11** (👍 2): I love how he calls the teacher 'it'

**CraftyCrafters** (👍 2): “it’s”

**SnappleJacket** (👍 2): The teacher is an it

**GirlRightNextToMeGGD** (👍 2): I’m a Special Ed teacher (still certified but my son is sick so I had to step out of the classroom) and believe me the teachers are trying.  Especially in MS where a lot start out under 32,000 a year (before mandatory retirement and other things are taken out).  I kept a drawer full of drinks and snacks for my kiddos to earn by not disrupting their gen ed classes.  I was scraping together change for gas, but I’d be damned if my babies (they were in an emotionally disturbed class) were gonna be let down.  People don’t realize that most of the time that’s money straight out of your pocket.

**THE-ONE3434555343455** (👍 2): my teacher used to just make us give her money for the pizza at school partyes, and for every single party she told us that the pizza costed more that it actually did so she could keep some of the money

**Ochinchin6969111** (👍 2): When i was 12 My teacher straight up invited us to a massive barbecue and bought lots of fun things like some small laser tag equipment and lots of board games she’s probably still the best teacher I’ve had though she wasn’t underpaid or anything because maybe my country is weird but teachers actually have a really really high pay that could reach to around 9-10k a month so it really shocks me when i hear that teachers in America are underpaid

**Leo1013** (👍 2): I remember back in elementary my teacher had this little cool idea where she had a long ass sentence (can't remember the sentence sorry) and for everyday all the students came she would flip one letter and when it was all flipped we would have a pizza party. good old times

My kindergartners always got a slice or two — but I did nanny on the side to ensure I could spoil my babies (low-income school/students)

**Irecentlyyes** (👍 2): We had to pay it ourselves. I meant the other students, I only enjoyed the food

  ↳ **AgentCreep** 回复 Irecentlyyes (👍 1): We had a Christmas party with our head teacher and she was wondering why no one is enjoying it.. well, it is kinda hard to enjoy one hour of giving each other presents that needed to cost at least 10€ (as a student who gets 30€ a month) and having a test with the biggest asshole of a teacher just after the "celebration"
Go figure

**Orthodox-Waffle** (👍 2): Every time this gets repoated the "It's" gets funnier. Like how do you forget "their" exists?

**[deleted]** (👍 2): I once accidentally  spilt coke over the whole pizza on the last day of school and the people who had after school detention ate it without knowing

**the_peach_papi** (👍 2): My sister in law is a teacher and I hear about it all the time. The kids need sugar and carbs every now then, and not from your own pocket but at least from the state. It only cost forty buck or so. Plus I'd fuck that piece of pizza any time 😋

**CouchPotato50** (👍 2): Teacher = it

**4thFloorLibrary** (👍 2): Wait, y’all didn’t have to pay for your parties. We had several teachers get in trouble in middle/high school because we did the math and found that someone was profiting about $100 per party.

  ↳ **captain-atomix** 回复 4thFloorLibrary (👍 1): Damn

**Mcawesome925** (👍 2): Teachers are NOT paid enough, don't get enough benefits, and schools skimp on things like pizza parties for the whole grade, to fuel into sports for a small portion of students. Thank you all Teachers!!

**[deleted]** (👍 2): i remember how sad these parties were and remember the time in second grade, my teacher had a going away party for me (i was literally her fav but not teachers pet style) there wasn't enough slices for her to have any so gave mine to her, she's such a sweet teacher and recently i emailed her and she's still teaching and was amazed at how well she remembered me although i'm in highschool now

i honestly feel bad for teachers, since they're the ones shaping the future worlds and they get paid barely over minimum wage

**[deleted]** (👍 2): am I supposed to sympathize with the teacher here because they are underpaid???? Don't promise pizza then???? Like do something else you can afford. It sucks that teachers are underpaid but this is like if I told my girlfriend I would buy here a really nice wedding ring and then handed her ring pop and said "well I am poor". Like ok, thats fine, a Ring Pop wedding ring could even be cute. But don't lie then?

**newresilience** (👍 2): Shout out to all the educators out there. It’s sad to see how many students disrespect their teachers in America. In India where I come from teachers are so respected by students, parents and almost everyone.

      ↳ **cityofbrotherlyhate** 回复 If_you_ban_me_I_win (👍 1): So no, and that's the difference they bvb had to go get a real diploma, which is very expensive and time consuming when compared to a "certificate" and teacher is on of those occupations that where getting at least a bachelor's is necessary, not neccessary in terms of it being a prerequisite to you getting the job so much, its neccessary that teachers have an understanding of the material thorough enough that they can then pass that understanding onto other, less educated peopl

        ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 cityofbrotherlyhate (👍 2): We don’t go to school to learn how to do our job. We go to school to learn how to learn to do our job. You’re basically asserting that a teacher should make more than me because they needed more initial schooling when in fact I had to spend much more time learning through apprenticeship then they did in class.

They don’t usually go to school to learn the material they teach unless they’re teaching at a college level. They go to school to learn how to manage children in groups.

Me on the other hand, I am qualified to teach my trade at the college level and I have held positions as a trainer for apprenticeships at more than one company.

The highest paid teacher was my history teacher and to this day I can’t tell you a single thing about history from his class but I can tell you the story of how he met his wife and got married along with other irrelevant shit.

  ↳ **TheWindOfGod** 回复 If_you_ban_me_I_win (👍 -1): But they want more money like everyone else always does 😢

    ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 TheWindOfGod (👍 2): And that’s understandable, but the disingenuous picture of some destitute teacher living in a trailer somewhere and having to spend all their money on pencils is horseshit they use to garner union support.

**TheGuyMain** (👍 2): Not everyone is underpaid guys ffs

  ↳ **donkey_tits** 回复 TheGuyMain (👍 2): Yeah it depends on the district. Plenty of teachers make 50k+ a year.

**amrich88** (👍 3): It’s lol

**BigLaddBen** (👍 3): I hate how people say teachers are underpaid, if anything they’re over paid, the amount of teachers I had growing up who literally hated the kids was phenomenal, teachers sound real good in theory but in practice they are never up to standard. Even when they are, teaching is a bludge of a job and even most teachers would agree. Teachers teach to earn money, not to help the kids because they genuinely care.

  ↳ **TheWindOfGod** 回复 BigLaddBen (👍 2): We get something similar in the UK for nurses. In comparison with a lot of the NHS they actually get paid a decent amount. Don’t see anybody fighting for the cleaners who have to mop up piss soaked floors though.

    ↳ **BigLaddBen** 回复 TheWindOfGod (👍 2): Exactly I think cleaners especially school cleaners deserve way more than what they get, we had a special education class in our school And not trying to be rude but they were very weird (because of their illnesses obviously) and almost daily the bathroom walls were covered in shit and poor daryn the cleaner had to clean it up

**Faceless_Pikachu** (👍 3): It?

  ↳ **EdenSteden22** 回复 Faceless_Pikachu (👍 3): When you don't know an animal's gender you can say it, although I don't prefer it because it's demeaning. You mean you've never seen a dog and said "it's so cute"?

Median teacher salary is $58k / year and median **household** income is $63k / year.  

I literally do not know what people are talking about when they say "Teachers need o be paid more" because they never have an exact salary they think is fair.

**cemita** (👍 4): Less money for police and more money for teachers!

  ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 cemita (👍 2): Idk bro police pay depends on how much they work. Make they shouldn’t pay teachers salary and instead do hourly.

    ↳ **cemita** 回复 chainsawtony99 (👍 2): Not sure where you live, but NYC’s police budget is 88 billion. While teachers struggle, cops are getting overpaid.

      ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 cemita (👍 -1): Hey man we all saw the results of that. Oh let’s take a way 10 billion dollars. Oh look gun crime rose 207% must not be connected. And you do realize that cops are paid hourly right? The amount of work is the amount they’re paid. And it’s not much. Assuming you work 40 hours a week and are paid 28 which I believe is entry level. That’s about 53,000 a teacher is paid 60,000 however, a teacher teaches. A police officer has deal with criminals and basically every part of the job isn’t safe. So in terms of a job they should be paid more.

        ↳ **cemita** 回复 chainsawtony99 (👍 1): Not sure where you are getting your statistics, but teachers don’t kill the people they’re supposed to protect.

          ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 cemita (👍 2): Well, kinda hard to not kill any people as a police officer. What do you suggest they do? Wait until the offender shoots them? That's how more people besides just the officer die.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): Of fucking course! They always make the students pay for everything

**cfitpotato** (👍 2): Anytime a teacher pays for anything with their own salary is a heroic feat on its own, plus who'd say no to free food!

**fxlium** (👍 1): The teacher who gets called it:

**Hightide910** (👍 1): Yea everyone gives teachers flak where I live.  My mother worked 25 years at 1 school then retired.  She ended making only 45k a year, and they tried to fire her at her 20 year mark, only until she got a lawyer from her union did she get her job back.  Its ridiculous how poorly we treat and pay teachers when they already have hardly any funding.

**bunnyrut** (👍 1): **Dear teachers:** you can try calling around to multiple pizza shops and ask them if they are willing to donate a pizza or two for a school event. We used to do this when I was in high school and a surprising amount of places did. If you call 6 places and 4 say yes to one pie, then you have 4 free pizzas and a good idea of where you want to buy pizza from to say thank you.

**Minimik75** (👍 1): That’s from the callmecarson video lol

**Hamilton-Beckett** (👍 1): I did a pizza party like this for my kindergarten class every year. I got the place to slice it like this to make the pizzas go further, but I still had enough for everyone. I always got 10 large pizzas, 3 with just cheese and the rest with pepperoni. 

They still had their lunch that day, and kids that wanted their snack from home with it instead of pizza were welcomed to. 

I even invited the parents that volunteered in my classroom over the year to come. 

I never ran out. I usually had a pizza to take up to the front office, one for the lady that did my copies to take home and share with her husband, and I had one for the custodians to share. 

I loved doing those parties. Kids had to “earn” it by working hard to pass all their stuff for report cards. 

The part I never told the kids is that I’d give them the party no matter how they did on the report cards just because they were awesome kids.

**anotheroverratedguy** (👍 1): We got handed 100rs(< 2$), when we asked for the professor's birthday treat, for a class of 60.

**zhuxiong15** (👍 1): It's mad the realisation as I got older as to how little teachers are paid, as a child you just assume they must earn lots because even as a child you understand how important their job is, alas... It doesn't seem to matter how important it is. You still earn basically as much as someone does working in retail.

**TheCatEmpire2** (👍 1): The teacher who is referred to as an “it” instead of a human “their” because they’re so undervalued

**angerylittlehoovy** (👍 1): Teachers aren’t it’s they are people like u and me some of y’all are just lazy like me and don’t do your work and expect to get a fuckin a plus

**Xrill_248** (👍 1): You know even if isn’t the BEST party still though. You may never know the teacher could be underpaid and may spent a lot of her own money

I didn't understand anything

**[deleted]** (👍 1): This is tragically true. My wife and I have spent thousands on her classroom and kids since the budget she was given is insanely small.


But if it’s the choice between her kids getting the education and enrichment they need vs not the choice is simple.

**the_jackalantern** (👍 1): The teacher who got called called it in a meme

*Sad cat thumbs up*

**Pats419** (👍 1): Fuck yea teach good looks

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Yup, you have to provide everything yourself basically. Teachers should get a budget to treat their students every year. My grandma did it for 30 years and always made sure to reward her students. Sometimes if it meant putting herself out of what she needed for a week.

**DrousyDragon** (👍 1): Most of my family either work or have worked as a teacher and I swear they never get enough credit for all the work they put in!

**Super_Jeff_1230** (👍 1): Really school party is all about not doing work literally you could just have us chat and use like random math stuff and we would be happy

**[deleted]** (👍 1): The party wasn't about food, it was about a free class where students could do anything that didn't break school rules. A nice mental break

**rLordOfLols** (👍 1): "their" would be more appropriate than "it's" it is just kinda disrespecting them when you call them "it"

**PAT_5251** (👍 1): We used to throw in like 3-4$ each so we could have 2 party sized pizzas and like 3 2L's of sodas, exept i would offer myself to buy the sodas myself because no one has good taste, so i would buy root beer, cream soda Coca-Cola and finally mountain dew (which was the class favorite) and sometimes people asked me to replace the coke with another MTN dew. Where i live, those cost like 1$ each so it was no big deal but the people saw me as a god whenever we did this xD

**iwenttoberkley** (👍 1): When I was a kid - the 6th grade teacher would have maybe one or two mornings a year that would just be a breakfast day. We’re talking pancakes, eggs in a basket, donuts. If we could bring something that’d be great but it was never required. Miss that guy

There was me and two other guys who she liked because we actually contributed worthwhile stuff to class conversations. 

Flash forward to thr next school year and me and those two guys ran into her after school waiting for out bus. Her class had a pizza party and she had a big party pizza left, so she just gave us the huge ass pizza. I miss that teacher

I was born in a Spanish speaking country and when I got in high school she saw my interest for the language and in her own time she would give me books and test to improve it. Now I live in USA and the English I got here (and improved) is from the base she gave me. Most of them care and lot but we as students, parents and directives under appreciate them

For these fun days we celebrate whoever had a birthday that month, we had pizza, cake, some drinks, and we even brought out a Wii, all we had to do was contribute $5 to the party. I enjoyed it.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Well, my teachers always do that during special days but my classmates and I always bring our foods with us so they don't have to spend too much.

**pancake_waffle105** (👍 1): seriously i’m still pissed about this one situation in 5th grade, the vice principal came up and told us that “oh this years field day is gonna be so much fun, you better behave!” and i was so hyped and good only to see that a few clouds ruined it and we didn’t even get wet, it didn’t even rain, so they postponed the field day, and i was hyped again, only to see that it was just extra long recess, no getting wet. i’m still pissed about that

**UpsetAward7728** (👍 1): Most of the teachers are good as they will tell what is right for students and will help out any struggling child. But some students who want their cliques to accept them as a leader don't let good teachers or good students to have their say instead opt for the choices that a few of the clique members have picked. Unfortunately such kind of students have spoiled healthy teacher- student or student- student  relationship

**[deleted]** (👍 1): You forgot to capitalize your T to begin your sentence, you also completely left out the t in 'bought' - also "it's" is incorrect in two ways - one "it's" = it is, though you don't call a person an "It" so even if you used the correct usage of "its" here you'd still be wrong. It would be "who bought it with their money."

Funded school trips by himself, let students sit in his car, do great experiments. This man was truly great. From what I‘ve heard he made a lot of money at the stock exchange and then went on to teach - just for fun.

**Oldmemes1921** (👍 1): There was one year back in middle school which I will remember for the rest of my life. My science teacher would treat us with little parties all year. So my friends came up with the brilliant idea to give back to my teacher and throw her the biggest birthday party that we could throw. We had the entire class join in and including the principal who thought this was a brilliant idea. Needless to say, our teacher loved it welling up in tears after seeing all the effort we had put in for that day. That will be one of my favorite memories for the rest of my life.

**AmpzieBoy** (👍 1): Since we all sharing school teacher stories now, so back in 7th or 8th me and my friends where the “Autistic Bunch” where we would not do good in school, mess around in class all the time and always inevitably have bad grades. After a bit of this the principle set this new thing for troubling kids and me and my friends where like the only ones there. Me having like 60+ missing assignments and my friend having 40+ they said if we done half of them she buy us pizza. Us being the broke fucks we are, we personally sat our selves upside and rushed I did like 40 in a 2-3days and got free pizza :) she bought each one of us our own since their was about 4 kids and instead of eating shitty school lunch we had pizza soda and watched yu-ghi-oh

**UpsetAward7728** (👍 1): When you grow up and realise that a teacher arranged an exclusive party for you to feel special but some students always whined about how less the teacher put her efforts in or how it's not as expensive as the party they would throw. But come to think of it as a middle aged person who is updating himself/herself regularly to make children happy and teach them how to make the best of everything from what they have. Will those whining students grow up to educate a hundreds of children and deal with their mood swings even in their 30s or 40s?

**[deleted]** (👍 1): When my oldest was in elementary, I always made sure to give his mother money for pizza and wings whenever they had a class party. I would tell her to buy enough to stuff those kids full that they wouldn’t eat lunch. One time, I went to enroll him in school and a bunch of kids ran up to him and asked what teacher  was he going with. When he told them, some were excited to be in the same class as him. The ones that weren’t going to be in his class were upset they were going to miss the pizza parties. He turned 17 this year and for his birthday, he invited some friends over for pizza, wings, and some fun.

**Pruwee** (👍 1): I remember I taught AP Statistics 2 years ago and because it was the pilot year for that specific class, I knew how difficult it was for the students because we all had to adjust as needed (because the pacing was way different from our regular classes). I told the class I'd buy them a couple of boxes of pizza after our review classes and they were pretty excited for it. Come to that day, I ordered the pizza 3 hours before dismissal time and the pizza didn't come in time and most of the kids had to leave and I was so heartbroken not because I spent so much but because I never got to give them what I told them I would. Some of them did get the chance to stay (they had no prior arrangements or plans), but I still felt real bad I let some kids down.

Where I’m from we say soda so we all had a laugh until she showed us the “party”: she had purchased 2 2 liter bottles of super cheap soda for a class of about 25 kids. Then when one person acted up she would push the party back and just kept the sodas on a desk in the back of the room. Needless to say nobody did good in the class anymore after that and we ended the year looking at those two bottles collecting dust.

We had a fire, one dad did set up a white blanket and a projector, we watched a movie, ate some sausages and had a little disco. The clue to make parents join is to make them know you care about their children.

**jawawawaa** (👍 1): Wait you mean that not all teachers ask the students to supply $3 for a pizza party???? I never had this meme happen in elementary or middle school, if we'd have a pizza party every student would chip in $3 and there'd be enough for everyone to get 2 whole slices along of the other food that students would bring in.

**i_find_humor** (👍 1): the average "underpaid" teacher in my community makes 75k on average for 9 months worth of work with a typical profession requires 12 months - so on average these teachers are making 8.3k per month based on 9 months of work - if they gainfully found similar work for the remaining 4 months they'd make AVERAGE 100K per year.

How does it do this? And how is this worse than the top 10% taking advantage of the lower 90%? Or using child and slave labour?

>or those who don’t value another human life as much as their own

Which is already a problem in capitalism. Capitalism is in the most literal sense, the high class using the lower class. Not valuing them as human lifes.


So my question is. How does socialism take advantage of the elite?

**hecseferblade** (👍 1): I distinctly remember in I believe 10th or 11th grade my literary teacher was advocating a party for the great gatsby. Day comes around and we are all dressed up, minimal food, one jug of juice, and a cake she spent hours last night making that kinda deflated. We all looked at it, pooled our money together and me and 2 other people took some students to the store and bought food, drinks, decorations, party hats. The works. We came back with an hour left for class and set everything up. The look on her face warmed our hearts. She was close to crying. There was enough for the next two classes so we left em.

To this day we still pool our money to send to her so she can throw that gatsby party

 you don't really find professors go that extra mile.

**Canatee** (👍 1): Can relate. I generally have 5+ classes of 30 students per year. Doing something fun with snacks near the holidays or the end of the year adds up quickly. This summer we were back in school right at the end after having done remote teaching for a couple of months, and to avoid grouping everyone in small classrooms I made various treasure hunts and such outside with ice cream rewards for everyone. I've never been so glad the local store had a sale on 12 packs of ice cream sandwiches as I was then.

**superchoco29** (👍 1): In my class we (the students) usually organized a little party near Christmas and at the end of the year. We brought sweets, cakes, chips and so on, someone even baked something (those who knew how to). And we shared them with all the teachers that accepted our offer. Did this from primary school to university. It's always fun, and it was a good way to show our teachers we were thankful for their work

So anyway, at the start of the year the class were separated into groups. the group that did the best, were most behaved and had the most points got a lots of pizza at the end of the year. my group only had me and this other guy in it so  we would get more pizza if we win. We won.

But our teacher completely forgot about it (we were so behaved you cant even imagine)

Now to this day we still ask him when we r gonna get our pizza so he said we could get it this year

But bc of COVID 19 we cant even see our teacher.........

**shaolinspunk** (👍 1): It's kind of traditional for kids in UK primary schools to bring in sweets for the class when it's their birthday. A teacher at my daughters school always brought the sweets for the kids on the bread line.

**wallewaltzz** (👍 1): Lol in Turkey the teacher starts giving the class a hard time and she stops teaching because she’s mad about never getting a party for her. The next day everyone in the class ofc except the teacher brings something. The teacher eats a shit ton of food and gets some leftovers to take home. Have had these parties for many many many times, the teachers have never brought anything lol. 

Oh also they got pissy if they somehow didn’t see their fave food or if they didn’t like what you brought lol.

**porcupinedeath** (👍 1): Teacher that are actually there to teach and cars about the kids deserve mad respect. They do this shit even though the government is damn near completely against them and get paid shit for it

**TopShaggerBible** (👍 1): 501 awards that’s 501 more than I’ll ever get

**SmokingGreenSanity** (👍 1): Oh god, i want to cry- i did this too!

I work in early education, and had a beautiful group of two year olds for three years, up until kinder, and then came the time when i had to say goodbye before they graduated for school. I promised them that i would get them something special, as they had gotten me things for christmas and birthdays, and i wanted to get them something nice to remember me- like a keyring for their bags.

&#x200B;

Sadly, i couldnt afford it nor had the time with my shifts to purchase anything as i was also full time studying. I bought the kids a colour-in dinosaur each- and felt like the worst person in the world because of it. I tried to make it up by making rainbow pancakes with them, but again, everything came from my own pocket :(

**[deleted]** (👍 1): My wife is a Mortgage Loan Originator in Arizona.  Sometimes she'll tell me what people in certain industries make, salary wise (without names or any unique identifiers of course).  Oh. my. god. Teachers are so comically underpaid here.  It's incredibly sad. Some newer public school teachers make a tad over minimum wage and have to work multiple jobs.

  ↳ **UrPrettyMuchNuthin** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): They should come to the east coast. Median salary is like $65-$70k. I have several teacher friends that are making almost 6 figures

**shadowdra126** (👍 1): I am a teacher. Never have I had an emotional reaction to a meme but this made me tear up

Maybe it’s cause I’ve been emotionally drained from work and online classroom planning and being told kids are coming back in person next month

But this really did it. It’s so hard to please everyone, but I try ya know...

**phoonarchy** (👍 1): I was like nice meme haha lol then I scrolled down a bit more and i got hella sad. Good teachers deserve the fucking best my dudes

**Ajha7** (👍 1): The teachers who do this are the best. My Spanish teacher did this for the class to make an amazing “Spanish airport” experience type of thing. I still have the airport ticket she made 3 years later because it was so sweet. Kids in my class really underrated it though and made light of the effort she made:/

**Party_Wasp** (👍 1): Love how the person became a thing.

**GhettoComic** (👍 1): I remember in like 3rd grade teachers from multiple classes did a field trip to a French restaurant and they collected money from the students to eat crepes. Shit was trash, none of us enjoyed it, when we got back to our class the teachers had ordered boxes of pizza because they felt bad.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): that’s the equivalent of a kid trying to be cool by making fun or being rude to the nice teacher

**katelyn-gwv** (👍 1): I like how it says 'it's own money' lol

**Cpt_Swivelchair** (👍 1): I see this post as a support for our school teaches so here’s my cheap mans gold sorry I’m broke 🏅

**mrinf926** (👍 1): How are teachers underpaid, they work 9 months out of the year. Have holidays and vacations.

**Crazed_Archivist** (👍 1): I worked as substitute teacher in Brasil for 100 dollars a month. It was a very poor school in a Favela in Rio.

Due to the lack of teachers, I actually taught there once a week like a normal teacher, but still got paid almost nothing.

I tried to get the City Secretary of Education to fund a bus for a school trip to the Museum of National History. I was denied due to lack of funding, yet I paid for it out of my own pocket, including lunch for all 36 kids in my class.

Same thing for the last day of class party, bought hotdogs and sodas for everyone.

**DaMailmann** (👍 1): An upvote for all those fucking teachers putting up with our shit, our kids shit, and the more to come.

**Mborg15202** (👍 1): In grade 4 my home room teacher who was one of the nicest person I’d ever know. The class found out her birthday was soon so we started to plan a party. We got cupcakes, pizza, ice tea and other various foods. She always came in late after lunch for some reason so we had time to set everything up. When she walked in we surprised her, she was so happy she actually gave us the rest of the day off to play games and go in the playground. I still remember that.

**professorzoom991** (👍 1): That's the first time i have ever seen 500+ awards on a post. God Damn!!

**Spice-Nine** (👍 1): There so many teachers that are trying to do this right now, while still trying to keep their students, families, and themselves safe from COVID (also out of their own pockets). “Room too small to physically distance? Here’s how to make clear plastic dividers out of shower curtains for only$100 at the Dollar Store”.  “I went to —— and got an air filter for my class.  The guy gave me a deal because it’s to help my students”.  “Anyone know where I can get an inexpensive voice amplifier so my students can hear me with a mask on?”  I see these posts all day long.  You may think that your teachers are mean, or boring, or they don’t like you, but the vast majority are there because they truly want to be and because they care about their students. Sometimes the constant stress turns people into someone other that who you want to be.

**lbarto123** (👍 1): It’s?

**MenthoL99** (👍 1): Holy shit that's a lot of awards

**LockwoodE3** (👍 1): Not to mention the teachers that did this for every class of the day

**themanje** (👍 1): I find pizza makes the best bribe. I bribed one of my students with a pizza party for him and everyone in his class if he met his reading goal. When you see a kid make a complete 180 so that he can get pizza AND get to make all his classmates happy, it suddenly doesn’t matter that you just used a week’s worth of your grocery budget to buy those pizzas.

**krosbydabonk** (👍 1): Bruh why does this have 500 awards

**over_wilde** (👍 1): Bro im from South Africa and didn't appreciate my teachers class partys till this moment. They are sooo underpaid its disgusting 😤

**Sheleah1993** (👍 1): Honesty you can say this about classrooms too. The board in my area doesn’t pay for anything beyond desks chairs and carpets. Teachers can order school supplies at a discounted rate through the bird but they have to pay for everything else. I paid for the books I teach, the art supplies, the puzzles, the writing supplies and paper, the math games (I teach first grade) the whiteboard. That’s just off the top of my head! In this time especially with COVID it’s nice to appreciate all the money teachers put into their classroom and all the unpaid labour they do (like coaching sports teams, weekend work, etc.) giving up their lunches, breaks and prep periods which then force them to stay late after school. For most of us, our students’ happiness and motivation are important parts of our job and we try our best on the budget we have which we also must support ourselves with. Yay teachers!

**jhavrocker** (👍 1): MY TEACHER MADE US OREO CAKES AND 1 STUDENT ASKED HER WHY and she said becuz i made it with my heart it was such a good cake and then she left our school ):

**KittyCatGamer0109** (👍 1): My art teacher in middle school paid for a lot of the supplies herself. We did things like sculpting, mosaics, sewing and a lot more. She would also come into class almost every day. She was in her 70’s through 80’s as well. She always told amazing stories and she was obviously cared about teaching

**FarFuture7** (👍 1): tell

**Alfa4499** (👍 1): This got insanely many up votes and awards

**_Wattz7641_XD** (👍 1): Just the fact that the teacher cared enough about the class and their success/enthusiasm for learning shows that they are truly incredible. I say kudos to any teacher who tries to uplift their students and offer incentives to make the classwork more bearable.

**veebid** (👍 1): Our class raised like 200€ on this winter cafe thing all the 4th graders made, and even tho we were promised we would all get a equal amount and we could buy whatever we wanted all we got was the remaining food and drinks that we didnt sell.

**Nickissupershort** (👍 1): As the son of a special ed teacher, she is underpaid for what she deals with. Kids throw stuff at her, break her thumb, etc. and she can’t do anything about it

**OCDbeaver** (👍 1): ordering pizza for a group is such a PITA. Buying for kids would be even worse. I had to become a pizza nazi and put down a 2 slice maximum atr work until everyone has eaten then the chunkers can fight over whats left. I ordered pizza one time and it was all gobbled up so fast half the people didnt get any, i ordered the same amount of pizza the next time with 2 slice max and suddenly we had excess. There is never enough pizza it seems.

**DJKratom** (👍 1): This reminds me of a time my Spanish teacher planned an end of the year party and people had to sign up to bring different food or drink items. Some people signed up but when the day of the party came no one brought anything, except the teacher who brought a 2 liter of soda. Most of the class was pissed but a group of guys were absolutely gettin live with that two liter of pepsi. We were dancing, cheersing, and straight up having a good time. It’s not about how fancy the party is, but rather the people you spend the time with. We smashed the 2 liter

"The most recent version for 2018 reports that, in 2015, the United States spent approximately $12,800 per student on elementary and secondary education. That is over 35% more than the OECD country average of $9,500. At the post-secondary level, the United States spent approximately $30,000 per student, which was 93% higher than the average of OECD countries ($16,100)."  


Spending is not the problem. How it is spent is. Fix that.

**jimtobin** (👍 1): Teacher here. I can honestly say that being a teacher means you "adopt" all of your students. Each student I have taught still holds a place in my heart. The paycheck is never great, but when you see a student you used to teach in the store and they make there way over to say hello, that is the biggest payoff in the world.

It would be absolutely unacceptable for me to provide materials to use at work, everything is turned into a PO or a rembersement form. 

Share your income with coworkers, do not provide goods to your employer that they did not pay you for.

Some people got mad, saying that the teacher was greedy and she should have paid for it herself. But most were grateful that she even gave us a party, it also made it so there was more food to go around. It made it feel like a  really cool reward for the end of semester, even though we had to pay/ make it ourselves. So thank you Mrs Pickford you are really cool.

Sadly, the teachers miscalculated how much everyone had to bring and after an hour,there was no food and everyone was still hungry.
One of my class teachers decided to buy pizza and asked : „Who wants Salami ? Who wants Magaritha ? Who wants Tuna ? “ and we had to raise our arms for whatever we wanted.
It was like, okay we gonna share maybe in groups of four or six because obviously when he had to pay with his own money.
Then the pizza came.
31 cartons of Pizza,to be exact.
I still have that Teacher.
He’s still a legend.

**5125237143** (👍 1): Never understood kids begging to get anythjng out of the teachers. Snacks, lunch, drinks... like wdf, your parents dont feed you at home? Teachers arent making millions, not especially the younger, newer ones kids usually approach. i respect n appreciate every personal expense teachers endure to make students happier. But for these parties not funded by school activities, kids rlly need to bring in sth to share.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): It's never paid by the teacher? Are you kidding me?  Do you have kids in school? Donations, donations, donations.
It starts out with a flyer sent home.  We're having a class party. We need food, supplies, and help. You can also donate money to help out. Party is a success.

Our children learn shit from the 19 century and the information given by teachers is outdated. Plus school is made to create a population of workers class. People who don’t have a mind of their own and just live to serve someone. The bell in the school is the same bell That rings in 19 century factories... it’s just a joke

  ↳ **William254** 回复 [deleted] (👍 12): Stop acting like all teachers are shitty just because yours were.

  ↳ **HeavyShockWave** 回复 [deleted] (👍 6): > There are more shitty teachers out there than good ones

Seems anecdotal... no?

I think it’s fair to say that when we are praising teachers we are praising the expected role and those that try their best to fulfill it

I praise garbage men, doctors, and nurses as well — but obviously there are plenty of shitty garbage men, doctors, and nurses who don’t deserve praise

To add to that, the good teachers and the bad alike are both being screwed over in terms of funding and support — which could honestly even excuse some of the bad teachers, hard to keep a positive attitude and a sufficient learning environment when you have zero funding and an admin that doesn’t have your back

Just my 2¢

If u have a crap car and drive in their neighborhood you’ll get pulled over. It’s such a joke. No reason why a man or woman can’t afford to pay for all the things needed for their family. But that’s the way it is anymore. Poor remain poor and the rich become richer and privileged. Such a sad sad world we live in.  I say the riches should give a portion to the poor and everyone would have enough food and a bed to sleep in. But no. They do anything they can to hide their money. All Bc of good so called lawyers. Or as I like to call them. Law manipulators help them get what they both want and prosper from it

I made sure to keep in touch with her to this day. I still know her, and talk to her on a regular basis. 

She was the best teacher and was one of the few which inspired me in life. I hope that everyone has or will encountered someone like that in their lifetime.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Sad story:
In 2001 I was a supervisor for 30 people. Our company sucked and wasn’t giving out Holiday bonuses or gifts. I bought each employee a $5 scratch ticket. This cost me $150. My salary was $20k, so I spent 18% of my bi-weekly paycheck on employee gifts (less than I spent on my family for Christmas.) 

They all looked at me like I was an asshole and were pissed that “the company” didn’t do more for them. 

Meanwhile, as I said, the company wasn’t giving gifts… so I got noting at all. It’s depressing as hell.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*

**LilacPug** (👍 1): My class used to get all hyped up for this purple lemonade freeze drink that one of the teachers would make. He would make gallons of it. Everyone would be on their best behavior to earn a silly party that consisted of a slushy and a movie at the end of the quarter. Teachers pitched in for pizza at the end of the year too. And we loved every second of it ❤️ so easy to please! And clever clever ability to keep us all engaged. Amazing teachers are priceless, they deserve so much more 💕

**Gayisntaphase** (👍 1): But the pizza was still bomb

**A_random_lamp_post** (👍 1): At the beginning i didn't really let it bother me, i didn't pay any attention to it. But after a while it got more and more difficult to ignore. They called it "The Big Wave", back in those days the only thing that could've been done about it is to just ignore it. Back then we didn't know any better or at least that's what we thought. 



Looking back on it, i am reminded of the actions that led to it, the stupid things i did and how shitty of a person i was. You could say things like "You were just a kid, you didn't know any better", but i don't buy stuff like that because even a kid should have some respect.



 The first time i noticed it got to me was back in 4th grade, i didn't think anything of it back then. But as time went by it became pretty obvious to me that something is wrong tho i could not point my finger at what it was. I remember that i started to feel a little desperate and i became helpless and that i wished for someone to save me from it but of course no one came.

**TheFoxandTheSandor** (👍 1): I teach the book clubs at my school, and always buy pizza for my students when we finish a book. Little Caesar’s has discounts if they know ahead of time that it’s for a school. Still expensive for all the classes, but it’s worth it.

Guess what? Those who liked pineapple on pizza ate the pizza without pineapple, with only pizza with pineapple left, which only they would eat....

I probably spent over 2,500 dollars out of pocket every year that would never come back but honestly you do it for the kids, it just sucks when you can’t provide more but the little humans deserve it

I'm not a teacher or anything, but recently received a message from a kid I went to HS with (I graduated in 2002). He thanked me for being nice to him and treating him like a person unlike most of the other students. He brought up the time that I defended him in front of a big group of classmates about his hobbies (drawing and computer games) and how he was planning on killing himself since he thought everyone hated him. He also had a shitty home life, lots of bullies, and had aspergers syndrome. 

It looks like his life is going great now and he has his own family.

I had sort of forgotten that whole situation since it was so long ago, but it was really nice to hear that I was able to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if I was kind of a loser in high school too.

If you’re a teacher than thanks for doing gods work chief, and on behalf of your students: you’re great, keep on keeping on

Although some teachers do work their students too hard and while not always the case, there have been a few teachers ice had that don’t seem to realize that kids and teens can be utter dicks without meaning to. Which is why some of my favorite teachers are the ones that never shout or scold the students and take the time to be understanding.

            ↳ **BanthaMilk** 回复 god_avocado (👍 2): the reason everyone on reddit thinks the same is because no one is allowed to have their own opinion, thanks to the almighty downvote. we've literally had to create a subreddit called unpopular opinion just so people can share their general personal thoughts and ideas without being downvoted to oblivion and losing all their karma to a comment which includes an opinion that is not generally accepted by people. reddit literally has almost no freedom of speech because of this platform's nature to get into arguments about the smallest things e.g. I was in a discussion and I mentioned something about how Ancient Rome had freedom of religion and this guy replied to me saying "wHaT aBoUt ThE pErSeCuTiOn Of ChRiStIaNs?!?!?".

            ↳ **chabbleor** 回复 god_avocado (👍 1): I love sea food, with the exception of shrimp. I thought, "shrimp is the most basic sea food there is, so if I love sea food, I must love shrimp." So every time I go out with friends or whoever and get dinner, if shrimp is on the menu in some dish, I order it. But every time so far, I have not enjoyed it at all and ended up regretting ordering the shrimp soup or whatever. My friends now question my love of sea food.

      ↳ **Def_Not_Alt_Acct** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 42): I had this one teacher in middle school who was an 80 year old irish lad. In a section about how the US won the Revolutionary War he explained that the US troops were farmers and hunted more frequently and to show this he had one group train for ten minutes by throwing paper balls at targets while the other just sat there and then had us line up and throw paper at each other

It was close to 20 years ago but he was the one who kickstartred my love of science by having us do about 400% more science projects (poster board and all...) than any other fifth grade class that year.  

I threw a soccer ball at his face once when we were playing at recess and he put me in timeout, I was dealing with a lot of shit at home and wasn't processing my anger at all.  I really badly want to apologize, and thank him, but it's been so long and I can't seem to find him :(

      ↳ **YourTypicalBoss** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 61): Honestly there’s certain things I want to get off my chest to certain teachers too. I never did anything like throwing a ball into a teacher’s face, but as a class we badgered the fuck out of a lot of teachers, particularly a really old Christian brother who (ironically) taught science. Because of his age we messed with him a lot (some really funny shit ngl but nonetheless cruel), but I know at least 3 guys who majored in a science field in college because of him.

        ↳ **Mysterious_Lesions** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 22): In our school, there was a tonne of badgering of the bus driver as well. It would be totally unacceptable to do this for a public transit driver.

But luckily all my other teachers are pretty nice and understanding.

There's also likely to be a few people who never mentally left school and I bet they can name they guy you're talking about very quickly.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 23): My 5th grade teacher just died last year (over 20 years after 5th grade). He was such a legend that there were probably 75 former students in their 20s and 30s that he taught when they were 11. I hope I can make an impact like that one day.

        ↳ **Clumsy_Chica** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Last time I tried they said they couldn't give me information on past teachers unless I knew their name and was calling for a reference... That was a few years ago, I'll try again.

But I'm glad she is. I think now, more than ever, kids need a kind guiding hand, and she fit the bill perfectly. Real sweet old grandmotherly type.

    ↳ **Silfurstar** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): The best part of the job for me was always past students getting in touch and bringing up events, situations or even details that I had forgotten but that they remembered because it meant something to them.

I still stopped teaching last year. In part because I have another career I want to focus on, but mostly because of too many times coming home broken and discouraged. I wanted to keep teaching at least one or two days a week, but I just couldn't handle it anymore.

I'm hoping this break will allow me to come back to it in some form in the future.

    ↳ **kaaaaath** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): I also like to do this to teacher who were evil to me.

My first day of college I was in OChem and my AP Chem teacher was my professor. When we had to take actual roll that one day she was like “your name sounds so familiar!” And I was like “...that’s because you told me last year I wouldn’t even go to college, Mrs. Resler.”

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): I added a lot of my old teachers (the ones I liked anyway) as friends on FB/LinkedIn. Initially it was as a reference, admittedly, but after a while of getting to know them it turns out the same people who I used to think were annoying for keeping me inside during lunch and making me stay after school were actually really cool people that were just looking out for their student's best interest. I still talk regularly with my freshman year science teacher for example, and my old IT teacher (I went to tech school instead of a traditional high school) provided priceless information for navigating college as a CS student during my first year. I was extremely lucky to have great teachers and I appreciate them a lot for the foundation they gave me and for showing me that there can be joy in learning.

    ↳ **Sunny_yet_rainy** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): This year, which was my first year out of homeschool, i had decided to email all my teachers at the end of the year saying thank you and had emailed a drawing of said teacher i had made.

    ↳ **spooner248** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): It also feels awesome to let a teacher know this. It lets you reflect on how far you’ve come and how you had some good role models in the past. It’s a win-win

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): My dad's teacher in primary school was an artist, she would have the class draw three lines and turn them into different drawings, she turned my dad's into a genie. Years later my dad got his first tattoo, that genie. He got into contact with the teachers daughter and when he tried to show that teacher she yelled at him and told him to leave.

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Was the tattoo on his ass?

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): No, its on his back and its giant, takes up his whole back

          ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Yeah, if a dude started to remove his shirt at me, I'd probably shut that down quick too

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Uhm, why do you have to assume it was like that? I don't appreciate you assuming such a thing about my father. Literally just a dude who thought someone's custom art for him was good enough to get it tattooed onto him. And why did you assume it was on his ass?

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Also her problem wasn't him being shirtless it was that he got it tattooed onto him

                ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That could be support creepy, she might've thought his sincere gesture was showing obsessive stalker tendencies, you don't know her life lol jeez, why yell at me for it?

              ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): The ass part was obviously a joke, and everything I said was gleaned from finding a rational explanation for your description of her reaction. Calm your chodes.

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Chode* I'm pretty calm. If what you said what a joke congrats, to me it came off as sorta condescending.

                  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Trying to see another person's perspective shouldn't seem like a condescending thing.

I've had a drunken night or two where I emailed teachers from high school and expressed regret for skipping class and assignments, and told them how they made an impact in my life and what I'm doing now. I send a good message drunk; nothing emotional or weird. But when I wake up the morning after I always regret it and feel like they're probably like "Yeah you sucked". Now I'm really glad I sent them.

The teachers I disrespected I usually did so because I didn't like them. I wouldn't reach out to them. I'd reach out to a teacher I liked who showed mutual respect (or at least pretended to)

There are good teachers but there are also plenty bad ones.

      ↳ **OverlordWaffles** 回复 KDawG888 (👍 2): Yeah, I've only done it once, and it was for a college teacher. 

The teachers I were disrespectful to were the ones that repeatedly did so to me. I heard recently of one that was a complete asshole 24/7 was then working at a gas station near where I worked and I really wanted to go in there and give him a hard time. I didn't end up going though

  ↳ **TehFuriousOne** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 50): Especially for a teacher. My GF is a high school math teacher in a underprivileged school. She deals with a lot of bullshit, way more than I ever would have put up with. She's said it at least a dozen times, the thing that makes it worth it is when she gets that rare "thank you" from one of the kids she helped.

    ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 TehFuriousOne (👍 5): Well from a student: tell her thanks for putting up with all the bullshit of the system as well as the students, we may not always be the Best But good teachers make us want to be better!

  ↳ **MikeWFU** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 5): My aunt was a high school teacher, she always loved seeing what her old students had done. She'd ask her classes to email her a year or two down the line and tell her how they where doing/what they'd chosen to do after school. Some teachers really care about their students and love to hear back.

    ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 MikeWFU (👍 2): I love the kinds of teachers you can keep in touch with after school.

  ↳ **CrimsonSpeedster** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 3): This! The best part of the beginning of this year has been my 8th graders from last year still reaching out to me and asking questions about how to prepare for high school. This is my second year teaching so already making connections like that makes me feel so good about my approach with my students.

  ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 3): See, I love reaching out to people just to wish them well. I don't do it for anything other to tell the person I hope they are doing well or something like that.

I posted on relationship advice a long time ago asking if I should reach out to my cousin whom I no longer talk to. Someone basically talked me out of it by saying something like "what do you hope to achieve by doing that?" 

I honestly couldn't give an answer and it has made me second guess reaching out to alot of other people.

    ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 Jackal7112 (👍 2): Sometimes toxic people don't "come around" to better habits, unfortunately. Even if they're family, it's often just more of the same when your growth alone isn't enough.

      ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): It wasn't even a toxic relationship between me and them. We kind of just stopped talking. I don't think my parents were very fond of them, but that's about the only reason. When I was younger, the only time we ever really saw them was when someone was dying.

        ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 Jackal7112 (👍 2): Oh, well then maybe you should reach out! I had a similar situation in my fam, but after I tried to reestablish communication, she didn't even bother responding so.... my advice is to try, but keep expectations low lol

          ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): I might just do that. Thank you kind internet stranger.

      ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): You assume they no longer talk because of one side being nasty when more often it's just because people drift apart and change their social priorities.

    ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 hwoaraxng (👍 2): Well I might not be your student, but I’d still like to thank you for teaching despite how under appreciated your job goes, the world would really be a darker place without teachers like you!

And in addition a lot of teachers pay for a ton of their classroom’s supplies out of pocket because of such low funding for schools. A lot of teachers work two or three jobs because their teaching salary alone can’t sustain them

      ↳ **cavemaneca** 回复 czs5056 (👍 48): While I agree with you in concept, it would honestly be more like $150-$200 to buy pizza for one whole class based on the average class size in the US. That's still an awful lot for a teacher to just spend out of pocket when they're paid shit and have to bring their own personal supplies into school.

        ↳ **czs5056** 回复 cavemaneca (👍 23): Obviously pizza won't cost $1000, but I wanted to throw a figure out there that would allow a person to buy 30 some odd pizzas at a time and not think twice about it.

      ↳ **grunt_amu2629** 回复 czs5056 (👍 -53): You can get like 30 Jack's pizzas for $90. LMFAO.  Y'all are salty, broke as fuck, and have no idea how to bargain hunt.. probably why you are struggling.  $1000 for pizza's??  Where the fuck you shoppin' my man.

        ↳ **The_Asia-Boy** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 17): He didn't meant only for pizza. He meant it in general. Are you not qbke do realise that there are people who need every cent they earn???

        ↳ **czs5056** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 8): It's not 1k for pizza, it's 1k of money that can be spent on anything after paying bills. Since this is being done at the school we need to assume that it's hot pizza being delivered not frozen unless the school is going to allow the teacher to use an oven in the kitchen

        ↳ **milkshake398** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 2): Who the fuck is jack not everybody has the same pizza place

        ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 2): When you're dumb but don't realize it you end up making comments like this guy's. Over here taking an obviously hyperbolic comment literally and not realizing how stupid it makes him look.

    ↳ **communistcrusaders** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 20): This has to be a troll, look at his posts and comments. What kind of real person posts that shit?

    ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 6): A) they're not talking about 1 pizza they're most likely talking about 20+, maybe even 30+.

B) teachers aren't paid minimum wage or anything but you certainly aren't getting wealthy as a teacher. Many of my teachers needed a second job to keep up with normal bills.

C) the comment you responded to was quite obviously hyperbole. Get better at reading comprehension.

      ↳ **Hazardish08** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 2): Also the fact that a lot of teachers have families meaning some 50-60k a year doesn’t seem that much and they will run low on cash a few times.

      ↳ **LethalSalad** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 1): Still, around 30 cheap pizzas would be like 60 bucks, that's pretty doable for a once-a-year thing or something. She sounds like one of those good teachers who genuinely enjoy their students' happiness, so that would be pretty worth it.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 2): I don't think you couldn't find 30 pizzas for 60 bucks for a school party. Even at the grocery store, if you could get 30 of their cheapest pizzas it would most likely still be more than $60. I don't recall ever seeing a full pizza for less than 2 bucks. This school would also have to have a bunch of large ovens that are available for use (which they very well could). 

Getting them delivered is really the only reasonable way to have 30 pizzas all ready to eat at the same time.

Edit: just my thoughts, I'm no pizza party planning expert

        ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 0): Where you finding $2 pizzas? Would probably be more like $150 which can be a sizable amount for someone living paycheck to paycheck as many teachers do. But, again, the key takeaway is the comment was hyperbolic, it isn't meant to be taken literally.

    ↳ **Yorokon** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 3): She actually had hard earned money from her job that she decided to use for such selfless reasons, while you sit on your daddy's money and laugh from the top of your crumbling castle. Doesn't matter how rich you are, a kind gesture is a gold gesture, furthermore, a large amount of money spent remains the same amount no matter what.

          ↳ **PayMeInSteak** 回复 jcutta (👍 1): I do have a vape. It's the only thing that actually helps me with the quit portion of the cycle. 

I have a lot of friends that smoke too so that's the REALLY hard part. They have no plans on quitting. Lol

            ↳ **jcutta** 回复 PayMeInSteak (👍 1): I've been mostly off cigs for almost a decade (I still smoke when I go to like all inclusives lol) but being around smokers still gets me hardcore wanting to light up.

Try using nic salts if you haven't. Any tobacco tastes like shit to me now when I use them.

Or let met put it this way: teachers everywhere are underpaid.

      ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 Samsuxx (👍 17): ok let me rephrase aswell:  
In germany teachers arent underpaid to a point where they even struggle to survive on 2 jobs.

        ↳ **Samsuxx** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 6): Lol do American teachers?

Sorry, I didn't mean to go all ACKSHUALLY on you, I was just venting some frustration having worked with teachers in Germany.

        ↳ **HazelnitBoyyy** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): A good part of America pays their teachers atleast decently. Where Im from, the teachers start at around 60k and make around 100k a year by the end. Plus, teachers get more time off than most jobs (not justifying them getting paid too little, im just saying it isnt as bad as it seems)

          ↳ **Aggravating-Abroad44** 回复 HazelnitBoyyy (👍 1): There’s more jobs that don’t pay than do. My wife’s been a teacher at 4 locations in Ohio and still makes half of what her pay should be. She has 10 years of experience. The problem with teaching is that you rarely get hired for experience but because your family. I’ve seen people sub for a decade and still not get hired when a spot opens.

      ↳ **gojirra** 回复 Samsuxx (👍 2): I get your point,  that all teachers everywhere deserve more. Honestly yes, bless them, but some societies actually do value teachers and pay them fair wages.

    ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 2): I dunno.    30.4 cents per kilowatt hour and 5.50$ gasoline in germany.   Still seems underpaid to me.

      ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 5): 5,50?
Petrol's 2,17-1,50€ per litre

        ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): I'm comparing to America since thats what the underpaid teacher salary is about.    And. I'm comparing here gallons vs germany in gallons.   There's about 3.7 liters in a gallon and every euro is about 1.18 USD   If then compared to here that teacher in germany is essentially paying 6.49 USD to 9.47 USD per gallon of gas.   Or gas is around 1.89 in most places with California being one of the highest by far at 3.27.

I'm just saying its still seems like tewchee get underpaid in general when compared to cost of living in a lot of places.

      ↳ **gojirra** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 5): Ok oil subsidy lobbyist. Imagine trying to guess the cost of living based on gas and electricity alone lol.

      ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 2): But 1. You don't need to drive as far as in the USA and 2. Stuff like rent is cheaper over here, as long as you don't live in the top 5 cities.

        ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 KingBellmann (👍 1): "You don't need to drive as far in the US?" Pff, ok. People here drive over an hour to get to work, as a general minimum, so I don't know your frame of reference here. I've always had to leave at LEAST an hour before my shift in all of the places I've lived or worked. My mom does the same. The United States are vastly spread out, with most states being filled with farm lands and ranches, meaning "town" is further away from homes. Even in cities, though, it takes forever to get anywhere because of congestion and traffic and construction. I can't think of any experience where I didn't work pretty far from where I lived unless I was in high school. Even when I worked in LA, a ton of my coworkers drove to their jobs from Palmdale or Lancaster, even Santa Clarita isn't very close.

How the f far are you driving in Germany to reach this conclusion, and why would anyone drive further than that?? I'm totally amazed if it's further!

          ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 laughingashley (👍 5): I said that germans do NOT drive as far and much as Americans, therefore we don't need as much fuel and higher fuel prices hurt less...

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AsymmetricPanda (👍 17): [deleted]

      ↳ **SpiderFlame04** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): That’s better than my middle school in Kansas. Most of the teachers were giving kids an extra credit point to buy a box of Kleenex for them because there wasn’t any class funds budget.

        ↳ **akatherder** 回复 SpiderFlame04 (👍 2): It's standard in our kids' elementary school that every kid brings in some ziploc bags, tissue, hand sanitizer, etc. during the first week.  It's part of the "School supplies list."  Then the teacher makes it available to everyone throughout the year.  We're a upper-middle class suburb.

          ↳ **SpiderFlame04** 回复 akatherder (👍 2): I get that, but you’d think they’d give free tissues to an eighth grade class

    ↳ **PostsOnGamedesign** 回复 AsymmetricPanda (👍 1): Would you actually being comfortable paying tax money to fund pizzas?

      ↳ **AsymmetricPanda** 回复 PostsOnGamedesign (👍 2): Yes, if it’s just leftover budget that was assigned to teachers for class supplies. Some of teacher salary comes from taxes and they probably spend some of it on pizza anyway

  ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 HookersAreTrueLove (👍 9): Oh the olderst 3 teachers had a fund for special occasions,should've mentioned that mb.

**PatimusPrime** (👍 2): In her head: "I am never going to financially recover from this."

**seanmadden** (👍 2): As someone who is getting into teaching now, I would happily do this for my class and consider it money well spent.

**cuentaderana** (👍 2): When I taught K on the Navajo Nation I bought snack for my class(they were scheduled to go from 8am to 12pm before eating, not easy for 5 year olds). I think I spent about 100 a month. I tried to buy what was on sale(graham crackers, animal crackers, goldfish, apple sauce) but once a week I wanted to make sure they got fresh produce(tangerines, bananas, carrots). There were times I are beans for breakfast lunch and dinner so my class could eat. My students would always get so excited on fresh fruit day, a lot of them didn’t have it at home.

**Altissia-senpai** (👍 1): I remember my teachers (chorus and history teacher) were doing a pizza party and I personally know they use their own money for this stuff. At the time I had an allowance from my family about 30 bucks and I offer to help with the pizza party in both by getting several (like 6) sodas: two diets and the rest regular sodas. (I am diabetic and I know some other people who have diabetes in the class) later in middle school I was known as a Soda dealer (and candy dealer too since I always carry candy).

**HippieWizard** (👍 1): What is mark 2? What are marks? Like a B?

  ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 HippieWizard (👍 1): Yeah second highest grade.

**PurpleSunCraze** (👍 1): In 3rd grade I had a teacher that talked non-stop about all the amazing things she and her classes in the past did.  All kinds of field trips, costume days all the time to learn about history, building castles and forts in class, teaching outside while the students played, just nuts stuff that sounded awesome to us.  

That said, we never saw any of it.  Anytime any of us didn’t the slightest thing wrong she said we lost the privilege.  Like the slightest thing, someone came in 5 seconds late, it was canceled.  Then she would go on for 10 minutes about how awesome the stuff was but we didn’t get it.

Years later towards the end of high school it someone got randomly brought up at a party and her nephew over heard me and laughed his ass off.  Turned out she never did that with any class, ever.  It was just some bullshit she made up to get her students to behave.

I don’t think he was trying to be /r/iamverysmart he was just trying to comment on the guy who said he didn’t understand why people cheat

            ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Exactly. You nailed it. 


Even horrible "crimes" (we decided they are crimes) like murder and cannibalism and rape are just normal survival evolutionary behaviors in nature. 

We created society and its rules but our instincts are still there, waiting under the outer shell of civility.

          ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 It_Calls_to_You (👍 6): I'm saying the distinction between wild and not wild is arbitrary and made up by humans to distinguish ourselves from all other life.

    ↳ **QuartzPuffyStar** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): > Thats why I don't understand cheaters 

People love differently , different people and for a different time. People also get horny with other people. People also get bored, lazy and don't know how to communicate. Some people just can't have one partner.  


Only one of those can be reason enough to cheat. 

Usually people go with a couple. 

Life is complex, love is complex, or it is made that way by the simplified expectations  and hopes that culture embeds in people since early ages.

      ↳ **Suekru** 回复 QuartzPuffyStar (👍 3): Then leave your partner. The only time “cheating”
Is acceptable is perhaps the cheater is in an abusive relationship and can’t leave at the moment.

But even then I’d advise against it for their safety if their SO is abusive.

      ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 QuartzPuffyStar (👍 1): That's why I think people should only marry if they've been together for _several_ years and are _100%_ sure they've met their soul mate and BFF.

I reckon the cultural perception should shift from being so focused on having a partner for life (especially in countries with less and less people having kids) and instead be more communal, if that makes sense. Don't focus on loving one person but understand you may love multiple.

    ↳ **cityofbrotherlyhate** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Cheating is obviously wrong but everyone has terrible and heartbreaking stuff happen to them (including sometimes cheating) and only a minuscule amount of people are so unable to handle these trials that they turn to one of the most selfish methods of coping, suicide. I'm willing to bet that in most cases where suicide comes as a result of problems that the person can't control, there's probably previous mental problems (or sometimes physical problems) that the person has been dealing with. To totally blame a cheating spouse for a person's suicide seems short sighted to me

      ↳ **CookieIsAMobster** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 39): Where are you from? Where I'm from in the US the lowest possible A was 93.

        ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 30): Canada. 80-84 = A- / 85-89 = A / 90+ = A+

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 9): Ye then that A- is more equivalent to a B+ or a B in systems where there's no A+.

Not a bad grade by any means, just looks better than it is when you're used to A- being really close to perfect.

            ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 7): Not necessarily though, because while the US system is designed in such a way that getting an A is possible through hard work, other countries have systems where getting the equivalent is simply not really a realistic goal. The tests are designed so that effectively everyone makes mistakes, getting even 90 percent right can mean that you are good at the subject, smart in general, and working very hard - anything less and lower grades are usual. I don't know if it's the case in Canada as well, but I think it's possible that that is why they changed the numbers for the letter grades.

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 8): At LSE in London I remember something like a 60% was an A lol. The tests were much harder though..

                ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): Yeah exactly! It sounds really strange to Americans usually, but I've lived in the US and in Europe and the tests in Europe are just way harder overal!

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

                    ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 2): Really? Where I live getting 90-93 is considered an A- and 80-84 would be a D+ (assuming A+ to D- scale). Our 75 is an F ):

            ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's rough. F here is anything under 50. With 50s being Ds, 60s Cs, 70s Bs, and 80+ As.

        ↳ **xLaZi3x** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 2): A good bit of Universities do a 10 point system especially technical or STEM schools. 

Never heard of an 80 being an A tho, would be a B(B-) most places I know of

Read the Canadian reply: That's interesting

          ↳ **ScumlordAzazel** 回复 xLaZi3x (👍 1): The grading scale at my university was different depending on the subject. Most were 10 or but basic engineering courses were 93 and up as an A and the really hard 0hysics classes had like 85 and up as an A.

I also know Canada secondary schools have different grading scales depending on the province. Can't remember what it was for post-secondary schools because I was only calculating US equivalent GPAs at my last job for secondary schools. India has grading scales where you pass so long as it's above a 34. 34 to 44 would be a D.

Also, most US high schools use the 10 pt scale.

        ↳ **RainingDeathx** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 1): They changed the grade scale where i live (virginia) so that a 90 is an a and a b is an 80

In my high school, we had this one math teacher who was absolutely drop dead gorgeous. She fucked another math teacher for a while and ended up getting pregnant.

He's willing to learn a whole new language, and this is how you treat the man? You are not a good person.

          ↳ **listenupsmartass** 回复 LastCommander086 (👍 1): I do speak a second language, and also: I'm treating him fairly and justly. I don't see what's wrong calling a spade a spade. He isn't doomed to lifelong idiocy; he can crawl out of the hole he's in, if he wishes to, but as of right now, he hasn't, and therefore, by definition, is an idiot. Sorry, but facts are facts.

            ↳ **LastCommander086** 回复 listenupsmartass (👍 3): So, in your world, he is an idiot because he is a beginner? 

> Sorry, but facts are facts.

Don't sell these as facts. They are not. They're your opinion, and nothing more.

> I do speak a second language

It's so cute watching you brag while you only speak 2.... Because I speak 4 languages, motherfucker. If you want to count my shitty Norwegian, I speak 5. I'm telling you this because by your logic I can declare you are also an idiot just because you know less than me.

Get over it. No one is an idiot because they're a beginner. If anything, being a beginner should be celebrated, because you're willing to learn something new.

> I don't see what's wrong calling a spade a spade.

Well, then you are a lost cause!

              ↳ **listenupsmartass** 回复 LastCommander086 (👍 1): Bragging? You presumed that I wasn't bilingual, and I simply refuted your shitty hypothesis. If anyone here's bragging, it would be you, but that's not the point. 

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

  ↳ **Aliensinnoh** 回复 jcutta (👍 34): Class moms work if you live in a relatively privileged area. Though parents fundraising can easily morph into a district underfunding all schools and only the rich neighborhoods get fundraising. Ultimately in the US funding needs to be moved to the state level to break the back of unequal schooling.

    ↳ **jcutta** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 18): Oh yeah, it's absolutely a mark of a privileged area. My town is considered poor compared to the town we border but we're definitely upper middle, median home price is somewhere close to $400k, and median income is something like $175k household.

I think state funding would be great, but I want to see the poorer areas be increased and the more well off areas stay steady. I pay a shit load of taxes to have my kids well educated and I don't want them to be handicapped to meet some arbitrary common ground. Bring everyone up to the higher standards rather than lower the standards across the board. I also think teaching should be a 6 figure job not $50-60k or much less depending on district.

    ↳ **TragedyPornFamilyVid** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 3): Yup.  My hometown has fabulous schools, funded through property tax.

The state redirects some of the funds to support impoverished districts, but the end result is a school that's 80 to 90 % kids from 6-figure households in a low cost of living state and kids from the one apartment complex that aims to rent to illegal immigrants, because they're easier to extort and steal from.

People resist equalizing funding, because most of the people in the high quality school districts moved there for the schools.  You have families that could afford to have a nice house and short commute in a different suburb with shitty schools or a nasty 2 bedroom apartment with a predatory landlord in a district where every teacher has a master's degree and a good portion have their Ph.d.

They're going to see it as selfish behavior by the people who chose to put building equity over their kids' education and now want the benefits of both without voting to raise their own taxes to fund it.

      ↳ **Aliensinnoh** 回复 TragedyPornFamilyVid (👍 3): Part of it is presumably schools funded at the state level would be funded through income taxes rather than property taxes. So suddenly all the towns spending half their budget on schools will be able to slash their property taxes while the state raises income taxes on everyone.

        ↳ **jcutta** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 2): Someone could hand NJ enough money to fund schools for the rest of time and they still would raise property taxes every year.

        ↳ **TragedyPornFamilyVid** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 1): Texas doesn't have an income tax.

Everything is funded through property tax or sales tax. As a result, they passed the "Robinhood act" to redistribute funds to poorer school districts.

For example,  between 2014 and 2018 Austin ISD increased taxes collected for education from about $700 million to almost $1200 million, but the budget for their school district remained stagnant.

The local residents could vote to double their taxes again, but they wouldn't be able to give their local schools any additional funds.  Those would be recaptured by the state. More than half of Austin ISD's students are "economically disadvantaged" and about quarter need ESL classes, but the land is valuable, so the district has to give money away to district with lower property values.

It's made them the icon of people who oppose that law, but the truth is that the state is obligated to provide an education to everyone.  If people don't want an income tax, this is the alternative.

**TheScumAlsoRises** (👍 2): >I have to fund it ... it’s just very fortunate that my wife is also a teacher so she’s understanding 

First half of this sentence I thought you were going to say you’re fortunate because your wife has a job that pays well, so you’re fortunate to have at least one spouse with a decent salary so you’re able to afford funding those things for your students. 

Both inspiring and sad to read the second half of the sentence where you say you’re fortunate not because you have the money to easily fund and pay for these things, but your equally underpaid wife is simply understAnding of how important it is for the kids. You’re fortunate because you’re both good people in the same underpaid, leaky boat.

You sound like great, dedicated teachers and mentors. Wish you all the best.

  ↳ **hungryhograt** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): I usually get an assortment of sweets, I bring drinks and snacks, sometimes we make things, sometimes we just watch a movie (it all depends on the class and what they choose to do collectively). Kids are encouraged to bring things to share but it’s not compulsory. The problem comes in with having 6-7 different classes (depending on the day). But I justify spending the money by telling myself that it’s only once a year and it’s a lot of fun for the kids

He'd scream and yell at one or another of us from time to time, and once he picked up a particularly difficult kid (he was kind of difficult for everybody) and held him against the wall by his throat, at his own (the teacher's) eye level...it was crazy. This was a long time ago (hopefully this kind of behavior is no longer tolerated in schools) and I'm sure the guy was dealing with a lot of personal issues of one kind or another. I feel sorry for him now, and whatever it was he must've been going through.

**dinosaregaylikeme** (👍 48): And sometimes they become your kids.

The amount of children that came from abusive homes that latched onto to me and looked up to me as father is incredibly high.

I have given so many students grocery money to feed their siblings because their parents couldn't stop using. 

I even had nights where there was a student sleeping on my couch because they got kicked out.

I even bailed a few students out of jail or been their "parent" in hospitals because their parent wouldn't accept the responsibility of parenting.

I have about 12 children that I all love dearly. As their only parent I made sure they got into a good college with a cushy scholarship. I know they can be the best they can be when they have to tools they need.

They all keep in contact with me. Some already graduated and are settling down and starting a family which makes me feel old.

There was another kid in my class who was genuinely a very good artist, certainly put me to shame and he always got an A, and deserved that A.  And there was one other kid who couldn’t care less about art and always got a D.

One morning before art class we three decided to do an experiment.  Those two other kids swapped homework and signed each other’s.

Sure enough, the talented kid still got an A and the other kid still got a D.  None of tried after that, if the teacher didn’t care why should we?  It killed my passion for art.

Pretty sure the teacher probably just found out what y'all did and graded y'all for the work you actually did. If y'all had been in the class doing assignments for that long it probably wasn't hard to figure out. 

But I feel ya, I had an art teacher when I was in 2nd grade erase a self portrait I'd done while standing overtop of me telling me how I'd done it all "wrong". Killed my passion for drawing at a young age.

      ↳ **Pete_Booty_Judge** 回复 AsherGray (👍 1): Take this with a huge grain of salt that I know only a very entry level bit of Spanish and French, but my experience with those languages at least is that their singular, possessive references really aren’t that ambiguous as they are still gendered.  

I’m more than ok with American English (I can’t speak to what other English speaking countries are doing) using plural pronouns to maintain ambiguity, as I think the context is even easier to spot in many cases as to whether or not you’re talking about a singular entity or a plural one, compared to figuring out whether or not “il” or “el” is gendered or ambiguous.  

I do think that English speakers should be more forgiving towards ESL speakers as I do honestly believe our language is a very difficult one to master and I have great respect for anyone that has bothered to learn it better than my own feeble attempts at foreign languages.

        ↳ **yellowcrash10** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): “Their” would be correct in this instance, but the point being made here is that OP used the contraction for “it is” instead of the possessive form of “it” to describe their robotic teacher overlord.

**I_think_charitably** (👍 3): Ironic that you correct someone’s grammar with atrocious grammar yourself.

**kakatoru** (👍 3): Idk maybe op's first language isn't english. I often make the same mistake, since in my language you very often, if not always, refer to nouns as "it". That's even if you're talking about a person who's that noun

**[deleted]** (👍 4): Nah. They made the pizza pay with its own money. 

Also, it’s its not it’s ... it’s is a contraction for “it is.” “Its” is the possessive form for “it”.

  ↳ **Daveed84** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): It's also a contraction for "it has", but otherwise you're completely right.

**Hslize** (👍 1): Irony that it should actually be his/her. Their is possessive for they and they is plural.

"I spoke to my friend yesterday."

"Yeah? How are they getting on?"

  ↳ **ano414** 回复 Hslize (👍 3): “They” is also used as a gender neutral form of “he” or “she”

    ↳ **Hslize** 回复 ano414 (👍 2): Its used in such a manner but that doesn't make it proper.

      ↳ **ano414** 回复 Hslize (👍 2): It’s the 3rd definition here: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/they

**ClaymoreJohnson** (👍 1): It would actually be "his or her" not "their".

Edit: For explanation, "their" is only used when the subject is plural.

      ↳ **Jiggy90** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 5): People that say this often have a weird perception of language as if its something that doesn't change.

"You" used to be exclusively plural as well, in early modern English and before.  Language changed as "thee" and "thou" fell out of favor and a singular second person pronoun was needed to fill the old words' place.

Languages change.  What we teach in school is a general "best practice" but even then much of the language stuff will change with dialect and time.

            ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): If this were a singular event referencing ONE teacher then the plural wouldn't make sense.  As it is being peddled as a *meme*, that means that it is tapping a collective acknowledgement that this has happened multiple times and that others can relate, so it should be plural. 

Teacher**s** hype up the class party all year.

I would opt for the he version of the sentence, as it is clearer about person and quantity, and I have no qualms changing the gender of the pronoun if I later discover that it was different from the default selection.

                            ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I still use thee and thou, but use is less common.  language does change, sometimes for the better, sometimes by brute force.  the debates matter.  as evidenced by the many words you have patiently dedicated to the topic, but they matter to me too.  the singular they was found its way in.  some have embraced it for political reasons.  and when dealing in certain specific cases, I can see its "value", but in general it is not needed and so we continue.  But thou art not changing (nor am i) and quite honestly anyone still following along is not changing, just rooting for his team.  since I have better things to do, I will concede the final word to you below.  I won't be replying on this post after this.

      ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 5): Singular they exists and has existed for centuries, clearly you need to learn more about grammar.

        ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 konamioctopus64646 (👍 2): by grammar do you mean

1. rules for clear, precise communication, or
2. examples of incorrect usage that have been abused for so long that they are accepted as correct usage?

          ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 2): You said the word you, which used to be specifically plural but has become a more neutral use, if you want to follow your “rules for clear, precise communication”, please use “thee” or “thou” to make sure you are using singular pronouns, because otherwise it is “incorrect usage that has been abused for so long that it’s accepted as common usage.”

            ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 konamioctopus64646 (👍 1): English used to have formal and informal.  I still use both.  But you are not deserving of being addressed as thou.  And neither am I.

              ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 2): Once again you use the word “you”, which was originally designed to be plural. Why is it that “you” can be used as singular, but “they” can not. This may come as a shock to you, but languages change over time.

        ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 konamioctopus64646 (👍 1): Has its place, but can be avoided and made more clear with just  a little forethought.

              ↳ **King-Of-Throwaways** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 3): “They” applies to everyone by definition. Your feelings don’t factor into it.

                  ↳ **King-Of-Throwaways** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 1): There’s obviously a major group not covered by “he”, but you already know this. Because for you, this isn’t about arguing sincerely; it’s about adopting any position that’s convenient until the opponent gets exhausted and gives up.

Try being sincere. It’s better for everyone, I promise.

**JabbaTheMutten** (👍 0): Actually, "their" is supposed to be a plural pronoun. So, since OP is referring to a single teacher, "it" is technically correct if you don't want to use "he" or "she"

    ↳ **MilledGears** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I know in highschool English class we were thought that although using "they" is nicer when referring to someone of unspecified gender, using "it" is grammatically correct.

It is worth noting this was over a decade ago and language changes with time. When I was taught this gender was still considered interchangeable with sex and gender identity wasn't a prevalent topic.

**EMRBRT** (👍 116): A teacher on a meme subreddit, probably searching memes to understand their students. Quality teacher

  ↳ **totential_rigger** 回复 EMRBRT (👍 93): Tbf I was a teacher since I was 23 (I'm 27 now but no longer teach) and I'm well versed in meme culture. I had more in common with the students than my colleagues lol

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 totential_rigger (👍 21): I know that feeling.  On the verge of 40 years old and have more in common with the new teacher than my colleagues my own age.  I have to pretend I don't know things just for the sake of saving face.

So this online instruction... easy peasy.  Not for others around my age.

      ↳ **pinacoladablackbird** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Same! Although I fear that the kids think I'm just desperately trying to be cool and relatable when I talk about memes and games etc. when it's just my lack of maturity at the grand age of 32.

**Embarrassed-Culture1** (👍 6): Same with some custodians, I used to bring tools, electrical tape, and fresh microfiber cloths since we were always short on that stuff. Never brought germicide or pesticide or other chemicals because there's laws behind that kind of stuff. Sometimes we'd go hunting with the principal and bring back a bunch of hog meat to make some pulled pork or stew for the teachers. I miss those days.

**AuspiciousAnteater** (👍 3): I'm assuming no, but could you tally those items up and submit a compensation report?

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AuspiciousAnteater (👍 2): Sometimes it is possible, but the budget is so tight that you generally have to choose between doing something at your own expense or not doing it at all. I teach English as a foreign language and, believe you me, there's no price I wouldn't pay to see a bunch of 18-year-olds play shop for 45 minutes. (I printed out the money, bought stickers, school supplies, fruit, what not, and they spent the whole class taking turns at the check out and practising shopping dialogues. It was fun. At some point I was not necessary in the classroom almost, they took the role play into their own hands).

Replying to this top-rated comment for visibility, because it's important.  

https://www.classroomgiving.org  

Pick a teacher in your state/town (or anywhere if you like), buy supplies off their Amazon wish list, ship directly to their classroom. It rocks. What would rock more is if states and communities funded their schools a lot better, but this'll have to do in the meantime.

**SathedIT** (👍 3): Can we donate supplies to your classroom somehow? My kids have been lucky enough to be in a charter school that has tons of resources for teachers and students. I know that most schools, teachers, and students aren't that lucky, so I'd like to help any way I can.

**mrbeermonkey** (👍 3): My girlfriend is a teacher and she does this all the time and it’s the sweetest thing. I often tell her to bill the school, or ask them to buy the stuff for the kids, but she never does. Buys every kid in her class a book at the end of every year and writes a personalised note in each one. She is the loveliest person I know.

Only on reddit do people see a teacher talk about their experiences of having to pay for their own supplies to fund their classroom and their response is to buy awards and put money into the deep pockets of reddit instead of to a teachers charity, this teacher's personal funds, or literally anything to do with teaching or education.

Aaaaall that jazz;)

**QueenRhaenys** (👍 0): And the only job where you get three months off in the summer, two weeks at Christmas, and literally every federal holiday. That adds up. I get 2 weeks total so I have to spend vacation days at Christmas

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 QueenRhaenys (👍 1): I don't get that much off. 6 weeks over the summer, 2 weeks in winter, a week at christmas, a week at easter. Still more than most people, what can I say, I love this time off,  It would be lovely though if I could take a day off during the school year for dental emergencies, doctor visits, etc. I don't need so much time off in the summr, id rather work as usual. It's the students that do.

    ↳ **QueenRhaenys** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Oh ok. You must not work at a US public school. I just assumed, sorry. Every public school in the US lets out in mid May or mid June (depending on where in the country). If mid May, they go back in mid August. If mid June, sometime around Labor Day. 

Still, I would love to have six straight weeks in a row off. I work at a nonprofit and am also “underpaid”...in fact I probably get paid less than most teachers and work 30% more but that is my choice.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 QueenRhaenys (👍 3): That's ok. I've got to tell you that those 6 weeks are both a blessing and a curse. It takes me two weeks to unwind, because the end of the school year is mad with paperwork. And suddenly, with the last day of school,  there's nothing I have to do. It's like running around headless, no rhyme or reason. But at some point I can really rest. And I have no problem with my own kids in the summer.

        ↳ **QueenRhaenys** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That’s nice! I can see it being a blessing and a curse

But I feel like being a teacher is seen as a comfy job where you do nothing. Well, wrong. You carry the workload, the emotional load, yours and that of others.   Have you ever tried doing it? What's your experience?

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -39): [deleted]

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 16): We're probably too sensitive, I guess. And you're right that teachers tend to tell people how hard they work. Idk, in the jobs that I did before becoming a teacher, no one told me to my face that my job is idk too easy, or my profession is for lazy people. I've been told numerous times that teachers earn too much for the job they do. I find it difficult to digest and maybe become defensive because I live my job, I get totally immersed in it, you know, with zeal. And seeing disbelief when somebody asks me what I'm doing at 8 pm and I say I'm working is a little unnerving.

But, well, what can you do. I still love it. I know there are teachers who are dumbasses, lazy gits or idiots. And I'm trying to do my job best I can.

            ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): we have been! but a lot of transphobic people were like “wahhh it’s not in the dictionary that means it doesn’t exist” so oxford added it in iirc

              ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): SOO many older people I know are hung up on thinking that language is derived from the dictionary instead of the other way around. Probably what they were taught in school 50 years ago so a hard mental construct to break. 

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

                ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): the definition of -phobia is a fear *or aversion* and yet it’s so ignored lol

                  ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

    ↳ **holdingmytongue** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): This also is why I’ll never be comfortable calling someone ‘it’, even if it is their chosen pronoun.  Gender neutral terminology aside-‘it’ sounds so inhuman and derogatory. 
I will do whatever mental gymnastics is required to avoid calling you that.

**[deleted]** (👍 6): [removed]

  ↳ **DouchNozzle_REAL** 回复 [deleted] (👍 9): Yes but the more appropriate term would be "their".


If I were to call a person an "it" I'm almost referring to them as property or as an object. The usage of "it" is dehumanizing. 



"It" is more acceptable when you say something like "it's a boy!" Or "it's me!".

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 DouchNozzle_REAL (👍 1): Actually, "his/her" is gramatically correct, as weird as it may sound. Their suggests a plural possesive, and op is refering to a singular person

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): No, English has used "their" as a gender neutral singular forever. The idea that it this isn't proper English is a lot like the "split infinitives" rule or "never end with a preposition" rule. In that you hear people claim it is a rule but it's not actually a rule of standard English.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Then why did i learn it in english class my nib

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Because there are a lot of “traditionalists” who learned those so-called rules and then also teach them. And there are also a certain group of language prescriptivists who think they ought to be considered formal rules.

"Do not use "their" as an alternative to his or her; "their" should be used only when referring to a plural subject. Each of the rules here offers a method of avoiding gender-based language."

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

        ↳ **swissans** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): The Bough......Joke from Johny English 3rd

**max_208** (👍 5): You gave credit, because that's what heroes do.

**Redstonenob69** (👍 2): U should also credit u/masellers10 for the bottom part (he commented on a repost the same thing)

**Effective-Complete** (👍 110): We should just give them more money tbh. It’s sad when they need to change a lesson because they couldn’t afford materials for the experiment they wanted. Or needing to crowdsource field trips.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Effective-Complete (👍 3): It's disappointing to me the lack of standing up too. Like with how america is set up as a ruthless free market, the easiest way to get change would be a nation wide strike until demands are met, sadly we live in a time where people are too replaceable without unions organizing it.

  ↳ **SlothRogen** 回复 Effective-Complete (👍 3): But they get summer vacation off /s

    ↳ **MetaphoricalMuse** 回复 SlothRogen (👍 9): A lot of us also don’t get paid over the summer or collect unemployment as we are still “employed” for the next semester. I’m a college professor who still had to work this past summer in perpetration for this fall semester but wasn’t getting paid.

      ↳ **SlothRogen** 回复 MetaphoricalMuse (👍 5): Of course I totally agree with you, hence the sarcasm tag. Just finished up grad school myself, which included teaching or doing research every summer.

        ↳ **MetaphoricalMuse** 回复 SlothRogen (👍 7): Completely missed the sarcasm tag. Sorry about that. We just started our fall semester yesterday and it’s already a shitshow. The college has no idea how to handle this situation, administration is swamped, the students our stressed and professors are being blamed by everyone for not having all the answers. I just finished grad school myself this spring and was not ready for this.

Congratulations on your graduation! Hopefully you’ve been getting a break from all of that stress

**K3R3G3** (👍 4): It's funny that whoever is greatly admired, called a hero, etc...you know they're undercompensated and give a lot. Teachers, soldiers, firefighters. How about we take proper care of them.

  ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 K3R3G3 (👍 1): You mean veterans, right?

  ↳ **MustacheWannabe** 回复 K3R3G3 (👍 1): I find it strange to group in teachers with firefighters and soldiers lol.

    ↳ **K3R3G3** 回复 MustacheWannabe (👍 1): Even when I explained why?

**TaintModel** (👍 18): Not all of them though.

**chrispdx** (👍 2): Too bad most people just seem them as glorified babysitters.

**MalHeartsNutmeg** (👍 9): This is a massive and incorrect generalisation of teachers lol.

**donkey_tits** (👍 1): They shouldn’t. When we had pizza parties we each brought in money that was collected. I’ve never had a teacher pay for our food before. I’m sure it happens, just not at my school district.

**notrachel2** (👍 5): This made me cry, too. I work in assisted living facilities and it is very much the same. If you want to give the residents something special or bring in something to do, staff usually buys it themselves. So sad since most of them only make $9-10/hr.

**laughingashley** (👍 2): AWWWW that makes my soul sad!!! Thank you for doing that!!

**MrGeekman** (👍 4): Sure beats them beating the “You better appreciate this because I paid for it with my own money” drum.

**Anurag6502** (👍 37): Of course the teacher is dead.

**hateeverythingnow** (👍 3): thine own money

**atln00b12** (👍 1): Yes, money from the pizza party fund obviously

**MamaBear_07** (👍 17): I’m a preschool teacher and we have $30 a month for class materials for 2 teachers to share. I couldn’t tell you how much money I’ve spent just doing art projects with the kids because my coteacher used up all of the materials money without saving any for me. But damn if those kids don’t have amazing art projects every week and they have a fun time making them

  ↳ **marsdudesk8r** 回复 MamaBear_07 (👍 3): That's amazing and I am sorry to hear that about your coteacher, being stuck with budget hoarders is the absolute worst!

**pinacoladablackbird** (👍 7): It's a brilliant job. Incredibly hard at times; massively stressful, and you often feel like you've put blood, sweat, and tears in that just go completely unappreciated (by kids and senior leaders) but I love it and wouldn't want to do anything else. I always felt like if I could make a difference to one kid, this whole life would be worth it. 10 years on, I really believe that I've done that, and so many of the kids are just fantastic human beings. Many are also little shits but they don't tend to be in any great numbers! 

Tl;Dr: go for it - it's wonderful.

**Daveed84** (👍 17): And it's not even grammatically correct... it should be "with its own money".

**K-leb25** (👍 2): It's not something worth focusing on in my opinion. We use "it" to refer to other animals, so using it with humans I don't think is much worse.

  ↳ **Riskay_Raven** 回复 K-leb25 (👍 3): I was just making a joke dude

**jabbadidnothingwrong** (👍 2): You haven't? That sucks

  ↳ **kashaan_lucifer** 回复 jabbadidnothingwrong (👍 7): No :/

    ↳ **jabbadidnothingwrong** 回复 kashaan_lucifer (👍 1): HEY DO YOU WANT PIZZA?

I screamed loud as shit

**Low_Release_6303** (👍 4): I discovered this meme just recently. Really hit me in the feels. I'd say this one deserves it at least.

**NenoxxCraft** (👍 2): THEIR own money

**EdenSteden22** (👍 2): What?

**Dammageddon** (👍 1): Exactly what I thought. Was the teacher a robot?

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Op panicked and didn't want to offend any genders

**nonapp** (👍 1): Or maybe because meme was of a cat.

**chainsawtony99** (👍 1): Out of curiosity, how much do you think they should earn?

**[deleted]** (👍 2): BABYYYYYY

  ↳ **aaaaaaa443** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): WOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**[deleted]** (👍 3): The negotiator

**jwse30** (👍 25): I would guess that the author’s native language is not English, and used “it” as a pronoun for something that could be either gender.

**captainhaddock** (👍 8): Apparently, the teacher is being paid what "it" is worth.

  ↳ **TheAceprobe** 回复 captainhaddock (👍 5): They was just trying real hard to be gender neutral. Also, it is a cat.

    ↳ **chaser676** 回复 TheAceprobe (👍 2): "their"?

**k3rn3** (👍 4): Possibly because their english teacher was underpaid :0

**EdenSteden22** (👍 2): Only two. Bough instead of bought and it's instead of its

  ↳ **Petrichor128** 回复 EdenSteden22 (👍 -1): It’s instead of their

    ↳ **EdenSteden22** 回复 Petrichor128 (👍 0): No

      ↳ **Petrichor128** 回复 EdenSteden22 (👍 2): I guess maybe his/her would work better

        ↳ **EdenSteden22** 回复 Petrichor128 (👍 1): It should be its or their because we don't know the gender, or if they even have one

**chainsawtony99** (👍 1): They get fairly well, about 60,000 a year average. But there are some really great job opportunities if they look for them and they aren’t hard to find.

**packle-kackle** (👍 0): Who cares its a meme.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 packle-kackle (👍 2): Yes because this is the only time a person will ever be referred to in speech or text.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): but... m’erica 😔

**Breach35** (👍 2): no

**[deleted]** (👍 3): I think he was just trying to stray away from tue whole he/she thing

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): (s)he should've said "they" or "(s)he" instead.

**red_fucking_flag_** (👍 3): No. The pizza obviously paid for itself

**chainsawtony99** (👍 -2): They get paid 60,000 on average. That’s ok, but there are better career opportunities. Like they aren’t that poor.

**andredragon7704** (👍 16): False teacher are demons from another dimension

**[deleted]** (👍 3): It’s pretty well-paying in the US when you look at total compensation, which is the actual metric we should be reviewing.

Their pension and benefits are really good. Pay is average for the difficulty of the degree and the job

**EmilyamI** (👍 2): American teachers are notoriously underpaid.

  ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 EmilyamI (👍 1): No, they aren’t. That’s just the teacher unions whining.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 chainsawtony99 (👍 2): [deleted]

      ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): You must be working in a crappy area then, the average salary is 60,000. Might I suggest the Department of Defense? I know teachers there that are making a lot more then average.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 chainsawtony99 (👍 2): [deleted]

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 chainsawtony99 (👍 1): [deleted]

          ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Oh ok sorry.

**MamaBear_07** (👍 2): A preschool teacher gets paid less than any other teacher here in the US. Yet they say Early Childhood Education is most important for children learning and growing. I get paid $21 here in the Bay Area but we are moving to Phoenix and I’ll be lucky to get $13. We deal with so much yet get paid nothing

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MamaBear_07 (👍 1): Not to sound insulting but my preschool years consisted of games, recess, naptime and not much learning. It makes sense to me theyre paid the lowest as it requires the least amount of training/schooling

    ↳ **MamaBear_07** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Not insulting at all. I am in the bay area and I work in a school that has 90% tech parents so they expect a lot more than games and recess. All we do is learning there. I actually feel bad for the kids because they don’t get much play and if they get any of their paperwork wrong parents come to me asking why. And if you have a bachelors in early childhood education You get the same amount of education as elementary teachers do. I am overqualified for my position. And the thing that makes me laugh the most is a lot of preschool teacher positions in the Phoenix area require a bachelors degrees yet they only want to pay $13 an hour

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MamaBear_07 (👍 2): Damn that is quite a difference for sure. I can see why you feel that way

**Pruwee** (👍 1): I'm in the Philippines and I can confirm we are underpaid even after years of service - that's why a lot of teachers here really set their eyes on teaching abroad.

**mdahms95** (👍 1): Go by year round school, work three months, take a month off. It still works out and students have a breathing buffer and could possibly boost productivity

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 mdahms95 (👍 1): sure. my point is that there are a number of solutions. i have nothing against teachers and would like to see them do better, but i do think it’s disingenuous to say they’re underpaid when the average 4 year graduate job works 100 more days and gets marginally more than they do

**SatansLilCumsock** (👍 3): This comment lead me to read about being convicted for statutory rape after being raped and strict liability. Absolutely disgusting, there is no justice.

**smallgreenman** (👍 2): Stay strong dude. That’s fucked up.

**tHEgAMER09** (👍 2): The students did WHAT!!

That’s messed up man.

**BogartingtheJ** (👍 5): You good at maths? What about quic maff?

  ↳ **CracamiteOnANewAcc** 回复 BogartingtheJ (👍 4): I got A+ in maths in roblox high school 2. Lol

**EdenSteden22** (👍 1): *math

  ↳ **ChillMyBrain** 回复 EdenSteden22 (👍 1): Not everywhere. Plenty of places say maths.

No worse at abbreviating "mathematics" than saying math. Unless you're proposing we change to "mathematic" instead.

**[deleted]** (👍 3): *it is own money

**MamaBear_07** (👍 1): Wow I wish I got paid that much as a teacher

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MamaBear_07 (👍 1): 80k CAD, its more like 60k USD, or even 55k. But yeah its fine for the price of things and all here. Its on the higher end of salaries.

    ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Wack, 60,000 USD is the American average.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): How did u do that did u make pizza in the school oven at the cafeteria or what or did u make it at home and bring to school heat it up in microwave or oven at cafeteria how?

  ↳ **gayfroggs** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I made it at home then cooked it at school, I just made sure to put it in a air tight tub and put it in the refrigerator

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 gayfroggs (👍 1): Ahh I see

**Its_Mavis** (👍 1): that is great

**[deleted]** (👍 2): The same pronoun they used for the pizza. Wow glad they gave him/her the respect of not assuming a gender and put him/her on the level of pizza

**Sophie74656** (👍 2): I have several teachers in my family. All make/made 6 figures.

**Kamica** (👍 2): It really can be a mixed bag. A lot of people become teachers for different reasons, and unfortunately not all of them for good reasons :/.

And a lot of teachers work off the "I'm an authority figure, you should respect me and do exactly what I say, no matter your personal circumstances" model of thought, rather than the "What works for my students?" Model.

**chainsawtony99** (👍 1): I don’t think that’s true, I’m not quite sure about a gym teacher but the average teacher salary is 60,000 so that’s either BS or your teacher is garbage with finance.

  ↳ **overmediumeggs** 回复 chainsawtony99 (👍 1): She was fresh out of being a student teacher and I am from a very small rural town in upstate NY. So, it was likely true.

    ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 overmediumeggs (👍 2): Ok yea that makes more sense, I didn’t consider that. Hopefully she makes more now.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): Why did u get in trouble u told the truth it’s like the meme where the black guy says why are you booing me I’m RIGHT!

  ↳ **Thepelicanstate** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): When you spit facts, people get their feelings hurt.

      ↳ **Thepelicanstate** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Just happened to be on it and it popped up.

**Khrot** (👍 2): The teacher is confirmed to be a dog.

  ↳ **SuperDyper** 回复 Khrot (👍 2): But the picture has a cat on it?

    ↳ **Khrot** 回复 SuperDyper (👍 0): Fair enough

**exSPiDERmate** (👍 1): A teacher is a scary thing that doesn’t have a gender other than teacher

**exSPiDERmate** (👍 1): Exactly

**[deleted]** (👍 2): Oh god no, not in the States.  School budgets don’t even usually cover supplies, education is ridiculously underfunded in this country, ESPECIALLY in red states.

**AgentCreep** (👍 1): We had a Christmas party with our head teacher and she was wondering why no one is enjoying it.. well, it is kinda hard to enjoy one hour of giving each other presents that needed to cost at least 10€ (as a student who gets 30€ a month) and having a test with the biggest asshole of a teacher just after the "celebration"
Go figure

  ↳ **Irecentlyyes** 回复 AgentCreep (👍 1): Lmao rip.

**Ribbles78** (👍 1): Gender neutral. OP wasn’t aware you use “they” as gender neutral.

**Ribbles78** (👍 1): God bless that teacher.

**Expensive_Breath3804** (👍 1): Right?! I've come across many more teachers that just sit on their vile ass and bully students rather than actual good teachers that are there because they wanna help kids

**ChampoftheCommieCamp** (👍 1): yaap

**Expensive_Breath3804** (👍 1): Haha like they could of used they but went with it

**MrTheStephan** (👍 3): I think you mean "their", but yes

**State16** (👍 3): meh. teachers work harder than you. that's that

  ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 State16 (👍 1): Oh? How exactly?

**NSDelToro** (👍 7): I found the ignorant blue collar asshole. Sit down.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): Honestly, $60k a year for teaching is complete and utter shit. A job like that should pay at least $80k a year.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): [deleted]

  ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): 2 year degree but you can squeak by with a certificate if you’re not the management type.

    ↳ **cityofbrotherlyhate** 回复 If_you_ban_me_I_win (👍 1): So no, and that's the difference they bvb had to go get a real diploma, which is very expensive and time consuming when compared to a "certificate" and teacher is on of those occupations that where getting at least a bachelor's is necessary, not neccessary in terms of it being a prerequisite to you getting the job so much, its neccessary that teachers have an understanding of the material thorough enough that they can then pass that understanding onto other, less educated peopl

      ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 cityofbrotherlyhate (👍 2): We don’t go to school to learn how to do our job. We go to school to learn how to learn to do our job. You’re basically asserting that a teacher should make more than me because they needed more initial schooling when in fact I had to spend much more time learning through apprenticeship then they did in class.

They don’t usually go to school to learn the material they teach unless they’re teaching at a college level. They go to school to learn how to manage children in groups.

Me on the other hand, I am qualified to teach my trade at the college level and I have held positions as a trainer for apprenticeships at more than one company.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): [deleted]

  ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Do less is right. I remember when the local paper published the listed teacher salaries. The highest paid teacher was my history teacher and to this day I can’t tell you a single thing about history from his class but I can tell you the story of how he met his wife and got married along with other irrelevant shit.

**TheWindOfGod** (👍 -1): But they want more money like everyone else always does 😢

  ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 TheWindOfGod (👍 2): And that’s understandable, but the disingenuous picture of some destitute teacher living in a trailer somewhere and having to spend all their money on pencils is horseshit they use to garner union support.

**ihaveacatnamedloki** (👍 4): Why is that downvoted

  ↳ **mrlegkick** 回复 ihaveacatnamedloki (👍 6): Because reddit is full of petulant teenagers

**donkey_tits** (👍 2): Yeah it depends on the district. Plenty of teachers make 50k+ a year.

**TheWindOfGod** (👍 2): We get something similar in the UK for nurses. In comparison with a lot of the NHS they actually get paid a decent amount. Don’t see anybody fighting for the cleaners who have to mop up piss soaked floors though.

  ↳ **BigLaddBen** 回复 TheWindOfGod (👍 2): Exactly I think cleaners especially school cleaners deserve way more than what they get, we had a special education class in our school And not trying to be rude but they were very weird (because of their illnesses obviously) and almost daily the bathroom walls were covered in shit and poor daryn the cleaner had to clean it up

**EdenSteden22** (👍 3): When you don't know an animal's gender you can say it, although I don't prefer it because it's demeaning. You mean you've never seen a dog and said "it's so cute"?

  ↳ **Faceless_Pikachu** 回复 EdenSteden22 (👍 1): I mean, I have, but that's a person.

    ↳ **EdenSteden22** 回复 Faceless_Pikachu (👍 1): Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You can say its.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Didn’t you hear? To create equality, all people will be known as “it” rather than “he” or “she”

  ↳ **State16** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): they also could have said "their, but whatever"

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 State16 (👍 1): Lol youre just now replying

**nobody384** (👍 5): Big brain

**[deleted]** (👍 3): Depends on the teacher tbh

**NimaSon** (👍 1): 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓

**chainsawtony99** (👍 1): Yea they get paid fairly well.

**DashFerLev** (👍 1): My sister's a nurse and she makes $80k and during Covid times she's getting hazard pay and double time which bumps her into the $150k range.

What on this God-forgotten Earth are you talking about?

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Where I live teachers are one of the highest paying jobs

  ↳ **DashFerLev** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): So... you live in America?

Median teacher salary is $58k / year and median **household** income is $63k / year.  

I literally do not know what people are talking about when they say "Teachers need o be paid more" because they never have an exact salary they think is fair.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 DashFerLev (👍 2): Ontario, Canada

      ↳ **DashFerLev** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Hey cool!  Our teachers actually make more than your teachers.  

Yours makes C$69k which is USD$52k

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 DashFerLev (👍 1): Way more than 69k

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 DashFerLev (👍 1): They make around 95-120k+

          ↳ **DashFerLev** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Teacher/Salary

You think I just guessed a number?

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 DashFerLev (👍 1): I’m talking about Ontario teachers

**red_fucking_flag_** (👍 1): "Teacher bullies pizza out of it's lunch money. Buys pizza party for class"

😂

**EdenSteden22** (👍 -1): Ikr? People see a dog and they're like "it's so cute" like what

  ↳ **jackrocks8** 回复 EdenSteden22 (👍 8): Bad example. Ppl use it as a stand in for gender if they don't know it.

    ↳ **EdenSteden22** 回复 jackrocks8 (👍 -1): True but it's kind of demeaning unless they use it/its pronouns

      ↳ **red_fucking_flag_** 回复 EdenSteden22 (👍 2): "It" is used for things that aren't human. Dehumanizing, sure, but a dog isn't a human

**chainsawtony99** (👍 2): Idk bro police pay depends on how much they work. Make they shouldn’t pay teachers salary and instead do hourly.

  ↳ **cemita** 回复 chainsawtony99 (👍 2): Not sure where you live, but NYC’s police budget is 88 billion. While teachers struggle, cops are getting overpaid.

    ↳ **chainsawtony99** 回复 cemita (👍 -1): Hey man we all saw the results of that. Oh let’s take a way 10 billion dollars. Oh look gun crime rose 207% must not be connected. And you do realize that cops are paid hourly right? The amount of work is the amount they’re paid. And it’s not much. Assuming you work 40 hours a week and are paid 28 which I believe is entry level. That’s about 53,000 a teacher is paid 60,000 however, a teacher teaches. A police officer has deal with criminals and basically every part of the job isn’t safe.

How does it do this? And how is this worse than the top 10% taking advantage of the lower 90%? Or using child and slave labour?

>or those who don’t value another human life as much as their own

Which is already a problem in capitalism. Capitalism is in the most literal sense, the high class using the lower class. Not valuing them as human lifes.


So my question is. How does socialism take advantage of the elite?

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Okay, so you’re a moron just looking for an argument. Have fun with that ✌🏼 edit: when you learn how to read at a level deemed higher than that of a 2nd grader, still dont come back

Okay, so where is your explanation?
And why resort to slurs? I'm simply asking you

                    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I report to ~~slurs~~ mean words because you clearly cant read or comprehend what you’re reading, so why argue? The only way to lose an argument with a moron is to keep arguing. So instead of arguing, I’m going to make fun of you

                      ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): But you never argued? You made a claim, with no explanation or backup claims.

                      ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I can easily comprehend what I read. You where the one saying socialism is bad, on my comment, so clearly you were coming in to this, to have a discussion or an argument. I wrote my comment because I wanted to make fun of the far right, and you ate the bait, but then continued to not saying anything of substance, except that "in socialism, the elite is oppressed". Why comment if you don't want to  argue your case

                        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I never said the elite is oppressed you fucking moron for the love of God learn how to comprehend what you read lmfao. You came to make fun of others but ended up playing yourself. Great job lmao

                          ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Okay then. Then "take advantage of" them. And you still haven't explained why, and I just wanna know why you think that would/do happen in socialism?

**HeavyShockWave** (👍 6): > There are more shitty teachers out there than good ones

Seems anecdotal... no?

I think it’s fair to say that when we are praising teachers we are praising the expected role and those that try their best to fulfill it

I praise garbage men, doctors, and nurses as well — but obviously there are plenty of shitty garbage men, doctors, and nurses who don’t deserve praise

To add to that, the good teachers and the bad alike are both being screwed over in terms of funding and support — which could honestly even excuse some of the bad teachers, hard to keep a positive attitude and a sufficient learning environment when you have zero funding and an admin that doesn’t have your back

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

I'm not a teacher or anything, but recently received a message from a kid I went to HS with (I graduated in 2002). He thanked me for being nice to him and treating him like a person unlike most of the other students. He brought up the time that I defended him in front of a big group of classmates about his hobbies (drawing and computer games) and how he was planning on killing himself since he thought everyone hated him. He also had a shitty home life, lots of bullies, and had aspergers syndrome. 

It looks like his life is going great now and he has his own family.

I had sort of forgotten that whole situation since it was so long ago, but it was really nice to hear that I was able to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if I was kind of a loser in high school too.

Although some teachers do work their students too hard and while not always the case, there have been a few teachers ice had that don’t seem to realize that kids and teens can be utter dicks without meaning to. Which is why some of my favorite teachers are the ones that never shout or scold the students and take the time to be understanding.

          ↳ **BanthaMilk** 回复 god_avocado (👍 2): the reason everyone on reddit thinks the same is because no one is allowed to have their own opinion, thanks to the almighty downvote. we've literally had to create a subreddit called unpopular opinion just so people can share their general personal thoughts and ideas without being downvoted to oblivion and losing all their karma to a comment which includes an opinion that is not generally accepted by people. reddit literally has almost no freedom of speech because of this platform's nature to get into arguments about the smallest things e.g. I was in a discussion and I mentioned something about how Ancient Rome had freedom of religion and this guy replied to me saying "wHaT aBoUt ThE pErSeCuTiOn Of ChRiStIaNs?!?!?".

          ↳ **chabbleor** 回复 god_avocado (👍 1): I love sea food, with the exception of shrimp. I thought, "shrimp is the most basic sea food there is, so if I love sea food, I must love shrimp." So every time I go out with friends or whoever and get dinner, if shrimp is on the menu in some dish, I order it. But every time so far, I have not enjoyed it at all and ended up regretting ordering the shrimp soup or whatever. My friends now question my love of sea food.

    ↳ **Def_Not_Alt_Acct** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 42): I had this one teacher in middle school who was an 80 year old irish lad.

It was close to 20 years ago but he was the one who kickstartred my love of science by having us do about 400% more science projects (poster board and all...) than any other fifth grade class that year.  

I threw a soccer ball at his face once when we were playing at recess and he put me in timeout, I was dealing with a lot of shit at home and wasn't processing my anger at all.  I really badly want to apologize, and thank him, but it's been so long and I can't seem to find him :(

    ↳ **YourTypicalBoss** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 61): Honestly there’s certain things I want to get off my chest to certain teachers too. I never did anything like throwing a ball into a teacher’s face, but as a class we badgered the fuck out of a lot of teachers, particularly a really old Christian brother who (ironically) taught science. Because of his age we messed with him a lot (some really funny shit ngl but nonetheless cruel), but I know at least 3 guys who majored in a science field in college because of him.

      ↳ **Mysterious_Lesions** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 22): In our school, there was a tonne of badgering of the bus driver as well. It would be totally unacceptable to do this for a public transit driver.

But luckily all my other teachers are pretty nice and understanding.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 23): My 5th grade teacher just died last year (over 20 years after 5th grade). He was such a legend that there were probably 75 former students in their 20s and 30s that he taught when they were 11. I hope I can make an impact like that one day.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 4): You could call the school and ask them for the teachers name I bet

      ↳ **Clumsy_Chica** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Last time I tried they said they couldn't give me information on past teachers unless I knew their name and was calling for a reference... That was a few years ago, I'll try again.

  ↳ **Hiazi** 回复 [deleted] (👍 4): Just sent an email to an old english teacher because of this comment. One of my faves. I'm a little surprised she's still at it... she wasn't exactly a spring chicken when I was there nearly a decade ago.

But I'm glad she is. I think now, more than ever, kids need a kind guiding hand, and she fit the bill perfectly. Real sweet old grandmotherly type.

  ↳ **Silfurstar** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): The best part of the job for me was always past students getting in touch and bringing up events, situations or even details that I had forgotten but that they remembered because it meant something to them.

I still stopped teaching last year. In part because I have another career I want to focus on, but mostly because of too many times coming home broken and discouraged. I wanted to keep teaching at least one or two days a week, but I just couldn't handle it anymore.

I'm hoping this break will allow me to come back to it in some form in the future.

  ↳ **kaaaaath** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): I also like to do this to teacher who were evil to me.

My first day of college I was in OChem and my AP Chem teacher was my professor. When we had to take actual roll that one day she was like “your name sounds so familiar!” And I was like “...that’s because you told me last year I wouldn’t even go to college, Mrs. Resler.”

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): I added a lot of my old teachers (the ones I liked anyway) as friends on FB/LinkedIn. Initially it was as a reference, admittedly, but after a while of getting to know them it turns out the same people who I used to think were annoying for keeping me inside during lunch and making me stay after school were actually really cool people that were just looking out for their student's best interest. I still talk regularly with my freshman year science teacher for example, and my old IT teacher (I went to tech school instead of a traditional high school) provided priceless information for navigating college as a CS student during my first year. I was extremely lucky to have great teachers and I appreciate them a lot for the foundation they gave me and for showing me that there can be joy in learning.

  ↳ **Sunny_yet_rainy** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): This year, which was my first year out of homeschool, i had decided to email all my teachers at the end of the year saying thank you and had emailed a drawing of said teacher i had made.

  ↳ **spooner248** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): It also feels awesome to let a teacher know this. It lets you reflect on how far you’ve come and how you had some good role models in the past. It’s a win-win

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): My dad's teacher in primary school was an artist, she would have the class draw three lines and turn them into different drawings, she turned my dad's into a genie.

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Uhm, why do you have to assume it was like that? I don't appreciate you assuming such a thing about my father. Literally just a dude who thought someone's custom art for him was good enough to get it tattooed onto him. And why did you assume it was on his ass?

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Also her problem wasn't him being shirtless it was that he got it tattooed onto him

              ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That could be support creepy, she might've thought his sincere gesture was showing obsessive stalker tendencies, you don't know her life lol jeez, why yell at me for it?

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Chode* I'm pretty calm. If what you said what a joke congrats, to me it came off as sorta condescending.

                ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Trying to see another person's perspective shouldn't seem like a condescending thing.

I taught a fourth grader to read my first year. It's my greatest achievement as a teacher. I hope he's doing well, it's only been a couple of years.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Bruh. In my country it‘s illegal to chat online with your teacher or have their number

  ↳ **pixlkiss** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): This makes me so happy. I've had a drunken night or two where I emailed teachers from high school and expressed regret for skipping class and assignments, and told them how they made an impact in my life and what I'm doing now. I send a good message drunk; nothing emotional or weird. But when I wake up the morning after I always regret it and feel like they're probably like "Yeah you sucked". Now I'm really glad I sent them.

  ↳ **KDawG888** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): > Thank you for everything you did, I'm sorry I was an utter shit.

The teachers I disrespected I usually did so because I didn't like them. I wouldn't reach out to them. I'd reach out to a teacher I liked who showed mutual respect (or at least pretended to)

There are good teachers but there are also plenty bad ones.

    ↳ **OverlordWaffles** 回复 KDawG888 (👍 2): Yeah, I've only done it once, and it was for a college teacher. 

The teachers I were disrespectful to were the ones that repeatedly did so to me. I heard recently of one that was a complete asshole 24/7 was then working at a gas station near where I worked and I really wanted to go in there and give him a hard time. I didn't end up going though

**Azureflamedemon** (👍 257): Especially teachers, they already always feel like they aren't appreciated enough.

  ↳ **InkTide** 回复 Azureflamedemon (👍 71): Pretty sure it's more than a 'feeling'.

    ↳ **Azureflamedemon** 回复 InkTide (👍 13): You definitely have a point!

  ↳ **alexalex19921992** 回复 Azureflamedemon (👍 1): Not true. Do ur job you have students thanking u. I was a pos until I got this teacher who wasn’t having it. I wouldn’t be an attorney without him being s good teacher rather than a lazy bum.

**TehFuriousOne** (👍 50): Especially for a teacher. My GF is a high school math teacher in a underprivileged school. She deals with a lot of bullshit, way more than I ever would have put up with. She's said it at least a dozen times, the thing that makes it worth it is when she gets that rare "thank you" from one of the kids she helped.

  ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 TehFuriousOne (👍 5): Well from a student: tell her thanks for putting up with all the bullshit of the system as well as the students, we may not always be the Best But good teachers make us want to be better!

**MikeWFU** (👍 5): My aunt was a high school teacher, she always loved seeing what her old students had done. She'd ask her classes to email her a year or two down the line and tell her how they where doing/what they'd chosen to do after school. Some teachers really care about their students and love to hear back.

  ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 MikeWFU (👍 2): I love the kinds of teachers you can keep in touch with after school.

**CrimsonSpeedster** (👍 3): This! The best part of the beginning of this year has been my 8th graders from last year still reaching out to me and asking questions about how to prepare for high school. This is my second year teaching so already making connections like that makes me feel so good about my approach with my students.

**Jackal7112** (👍 3): See, I love reaching out to people just to wish them well. I don't do it for anything other to tell the person I hope they are doing well or something like that.

I posted on relationship advice a long time ago asking if I should reach out to my cousin whom I no longer talk to. Someone basically talked me out of it by saying something like "what do you hope to achieve by doing that?" 

I honestly couldn't give an answer and it has made me second guess reaching out to alot of other people.

  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 Jackal7112 (👍 2): Sometimes toxic people don't "come around" to better habits, unfortunately. Even if they're family, it's often just more of the same when your growth alone isn't enough.

    ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): It wasn't even a toxic relationship between me and them. We kind of just stopped talking. I don't think my parents were very fond of them, but that's about the only reason. When I was younger, the only time we ever really saw them was when someone was dying.

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 Jackal7112 (👍 2): Oh, well then maybe you should reach out! I had a similar situation in my fam, but after I tried to reestablish communication, she didn't even bother responding so.... my advice is to try, but keep expectations low lol

        ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): I might just do that. Thank you kind internet stranger.

    ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): You assume they no longer talk because of one side being nasty when more often it's just because people drift apart and change their social priorities.

**hwoaraxng** (👍 3): As a teacher I can indeed confirm that such messages can make a day/the whole week

  ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 hwoaraxng (👍 2): Well I might not be your student, but I’d still like to thank you for teaching despite how under appreciated your job goes, the world would really be a darker place without teachers like you!

    ↳ **hwoaraxng** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 1): thank you, I appreciate your comment

**Ashkir** (👍 3): I found my old Make A Wish coordinator on Facebook earlier this year. She had been by my side through my entire childhood for every surgery. 

I reached out to her and told her I appreciate her right before my heart transplant. 

She told me she was questioning her life and whatever she did if it was worth it. And thanked me tremendously.

              ↳ **GhettoComic** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 14): No you literally just said “in the west its alot especially for teachers” you implied its alot for everyone more so teachers. This isnt true, live in a big city and it really isnt much. Stop trying so hard to twist what I said.

                  ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 MammothImplement1066 (👍 2): I saw a document of my own school (high school) and the teachers made around 90-120k, some quite a bit more. I’m in Canada tho

        ↳ **SLEDGEHAMMAA** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): In the west, it's still a lot, but not an incredible amount if it's only once a year. $100 is only like 2 or 3 days or working minimum wage

And in addition a lot of teachers pay for a ton of their classroom’s supplies out of pocket because of such low funding for schools. A lot of teachers work two or three jobs because their teaching salary alone can’t sustain them

That's still an awful lot for a teacher to just spend out of pocket when they're paid shit and have to bring their own personal supplies into school.

      ↳ **czs5056** 回复 cavemaneca (👍 23): Obviously pizza won't cost $1000, but I wanted to throw a figure out there that would allow a person to buy 30 some odd pizzas at a time and not think twice about it.

      ↳ **czs5056** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 8): It's not 1k for pizza, it's 1k of money that can be spent on anything after paying bills. Since this is being done at the school we need to assume that it's hot pizza being delivered not frozen unless the school is going to allow the teacher to use an oven in the kitchen

  ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 6): A) they're not talking about 1 pizza they're most likely talking about 20+, maybe even 30+.

B) teachers aren't paid minimum wage or anything but you certainly aren't getting wealthy as a teacher. Many of my teachers needed a second job to keep up with normal bills.

C) the comment you responded to was quite obviously hyperbole. Get better at reading comprehension.

    ↳ **Hazardish08** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 2): Also the fact that a lot of teachers have families meaning some 50-60k a year doesn’t seem that much and they will run low on cash a few times.

    ↳ **LethalSalad** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 1): Still, around 30 cheap pizzas would be like 60 bucks, that's pretty doable for a once-a-year thing or something. She sounds like one of those good teachers who genuinely enjoy their students' happiness, so that would be pretty worth it.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 2): I don't think you couldn't find 30 pizzas for 60 bucks for a school party. Even at the grocery store, if you could get 30 of their cheapest pizzas it would most likely still be more than $60. I don't recall ever seeing a full pizza for less than 2 bucks. This school would also have to have a bunch of large ovens that are available for use (which they very well could). 

Getting them delivered is really the only reasonable way to have 30 pizzas all ready to eat at the same time.

Edit: just my thoughts, I'm no pizza party planning expert

      ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 0): Where you finding $2 pizzas? Would probably be more like $150 which can be a sizable amount for someone living paycheck to paycheck as many teachers do. But, again, the key takeaway is the comment was hyperbolic, it isn't meant to be taken literally.

**waitingtodiesoon** (👍 163): Our school had it if we all passed the TAKS test I think, our principal would kiss a pig on the morning announcement.

    ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 Samsuxx (👍 17): ok let me rephrase aswell:  
In germany teachers arent underpaid to a point where they even struggle to survive on 2 jobs.

      ↳ **Samsuxx** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 6): Lol do American teachers?

Sorry, I didn't mean to go all ACKSHUALLY on you, I was just venting some frustration having worked with teachers in Germany.

      ↳ **HazelnitBoyyy** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): A good part of America pays their teachers atleast decently. Where Im from, the teachers start at around 60k and make around 100k a year by the end. Plus, teachers get more time off than most jobs (not justifying them getting paid too little, im just saying it isnt as bad as it seems)

        ↳ **Aggravating-Abroad44** 回复 HazelnitBoyyy (👍 1): There’s more jobs that don’t pay than do. My wife’s been a teacher at 4 locations in Ohio and still makes half of what her pay should be. She has 10 years of experience. The problem with teaching is that you rarely get hired for experience but because your family. I’ve seen people sub for a decade and still not get hired when a spot opens.

    ↳ **gojirra** 回复 Samsuxx (👍 2): I get your point,  that all teachers everywhere deserve more. Honestly yes, bless them, but some societies actually do value teachers and pay them fair wages.

  ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 2): I dunno.    30.4 cents per kilowatt hour and 5.50$ gasoline in germany.   Still seems underpaid to me.

    ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 5): 5,50?
Petrol's 2,17-1,50€ per litre

      ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): I'm comparing to America since thats what the underpaid teacher salary is about.    And. I'm comparing here gallons vs germany in gallons.   There's about 3.7 liters in a gallon and every euro is about 1.18 USD   If then compared to here that teacher in germany is essentially paying 6.49 USD to 9.47 USD per gallon of gas.   Or gas is around 1.89 in most places with California being one of the highest by far at 3.27.

I'm just saying its still seems like tewchee get underpaid in general when compared to cost of living in a lot of places.

    ↳ **gojirra** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 5): Ok oil subsidy lobbyist. Imagine trying to guess the cost of living based on gas and electricity alone lol.

    ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 2): But 1. You don't need to drive as far as in the USA and 2. Stuff like rent is cheaper over here, as long as you don't live in the top 5 cities.

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 KingBellmann (👍 1): "You don't need to drive as far in the US?" Pff, ok. People here drive over an hour to get to work, as a general minimum, so I don't know your frame of reference here. I've always had to leave at LEAST an hour before my shift in all of the places I've lived or worked. My mom does the same. The United States are vastly spread out, with most states being filled with farm lands and ranches, meaning "town" is further away from homes. Even in cities, though, it takes forever to get anywhere because of congestion and traffic and construction. I can't think of any experience where I didn't work pretty far from where I lived unless I was in high school. Even when I worked in LA, a ton of my coworkers drove to their jobs from Palmdale or Lancaster, even Santa Clarita isn't very close.

How the f far are you driving in Germany to reach this conclusion, and why would anyone drive further than that?? I'm totally amazed if it's further!

        ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 laughingashley (👍 5): I said that germans do NOT drive as far and much as Americans, therefore we don't need as much fuel and higher fuel prices hurt less...

      ↳ **akatherder** 回复 SpiderFlame04 (👍 2): It's standard in our kids' elementary school that every kid brings in some ziploc bags, tissue, hand sanitizer, etc. during the first week.  It's part of the "School supplies list."  Then the teacher makes it available to everyone throughout the year.  We're a upper-middle class suburb.

I don’t think he was trying to be /r/iamverysmart he was just trying to comment on the guy who said he didn’t understand why people cheat

  ↳ **QuartzPuffyStar** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): > Thats why I don't understand cheaters 

People love differently , different people and for a different time. People also get horny with other people. People also get bored, lazy and don't know how to communicate. Some people just can't have one partner.  


Only one of those can be reason enough to cheat. 

Usually people go with a couple. 

Life is complex, love is complex, or it is made that way by the simplified expectations  and hopes that culture embeds in people since early ages.

    ↳ **Suekru** 回复 QuartzPuffyStar (👍 3): Then leave your partner. The only time “cheating”
Is acceptable is perhaps the cheater is in an abusive relationship and can’t leave at the moment.

But even then I’d advise against it for their safety if their SO is abusive.

    ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 QuartzPuffyStar (👍 1): That's why I think people should only marry if they've been together for _several_ years and are _100%_ sure they've met their soul mate and BFF.

I reckon the cultural perception should shift from being so focused on having a partner for life (especially in countries with less and less people having kids) and instead be more communal, if that makes sense. Don't focus on loving one person but understand you may love multiple.

  ↳ **cityofbrotherlyhate** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Cheating is obviously wrong but everyone has terrible and heartbreaking stuff happen to them (including sometimes cheating) and only a minuscule amount of people are so unable to handle these trials that they turn to one of the most selfish methods of coping, suicide. I'm willing to bet that in most cases where suicide comes as a result of problems that the person can't control, there's probably previous mental problems (or sometimes physical problems) that the person has been dealing with. To totally blame a cheating spouse for a person's suicide seems short sighted to me

    ↳ **CookieIsAMobster** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 39): Where are you from? Where I'm from in the US the lowest possible A was 93.

      ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 30): Canada. 80-84 = A- / 85-89 = A / 90+ = A+

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 9): Ye then that A- is more equivalent to a B+ or a B in systems where there's no A+.

Not a bad grade by any means, just looks better than it is when you're used to A- being really close to perfect.

          ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 7): Not necessarily though, because while the US system is designed in such a way that getting an A is possible through hard work, other countries have systems where getting the equivalent is simply not really a realistic goal. The tests are designed so that effectively everyone makes mistakes, getting even 90 percent right can mean that you are good at the subject, smart in general, and working very hard - anything less and lower grades are usual. I don't know if it's the case in Canada as well, but I think it's possible that that is why they changed the numbers for the letter grades.

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 8): At LSE in London I remember something like a 60% was an A lol. The tests were much harder though..

              ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): Yeah exactly! It sounds really strange to Americans usually, but I've lived in the US and in Europe and the tests in Europe are just way harder overal!

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

                  ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 2): Really? Where I live getting 90-93 is considered an A- and 80-84 would be a D+ (assuming A+ to D- scale). Our 75 is an F ):

          ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's rough. F here is anything under 50. With 50s being Ds, 60s Cs, 70s Bs, and 80+ As.

      ↳ **xLaZi3x** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 2): A good bit of Universities do a 10 point system especially technical or STEM schools. 

Never heard of an 80 being an A tho, would be a B(B-) most places I know of

Read the Canadian reply: That's interesting

        ↳ **ScumlordAzazel** 回复 xLaZi3x (👍 1): The grading scale at my university was different depending on the subject. Most were 10 or but basic engineering courses were 93 and up as an A and the really hard 0hysics classes had like 85 and up as an A.

I also know Canada secondary schools have different grading scales depending on the province. Can't remember what it was for post-secondary schools because I was only calculating US equivalent GPAs at my last job for secondary schools. India has grading scales where you pass so long as it's above a 34. 34 to 44 would be a D.

Also, most US high schools use the 10 pt scale.

      ↳ **RainingDeathx** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 1): They changed the grade scale where i live (virginia) so that a 90 is an a and a b is an 80

In my high school, we had this one math teacher who was absolutely drop dead gorgeous. She fucked another math teacher for a while and ended up getting pregnant. She might've been able to convince her husband that it was his child except that he had gotten a complete vasectomy a few years prior to this.

He isn't doomed to lifelong idiocy; he can crawl out of the hole he's in, if he wishes to, but as of right now, he hasn't, and therefore, by definition, is an idiot. Sorry, but facts are facts.

          ↳ **LastCommander086** 回复 listenupsmartass (👍 3): So, in your world, he is an idiot because he is a beginner? 

> Sorry, but facts are facts.

Don't sell these as facts. They are not. They're your opinion, and nothing more.

> I do speak a second language

It's so cute watching you brag while you only speak 2.... Because I speak 4 languages, motherfucker. If you want to count my shitty Norwegian, I speak 5. I'm telling you this because by your logic I can declare you are also an idiot just because you know less than me.

Get over it. No one is an idiot because they're a beginner. If anything, being a beginner should be celebrated, because you're willing to learn something new.

> I don't see what's wrong calling a spade a spade.

Well, then you are a lost cause!

            ↳ **listenupsmartass** 回复 LastCommander086 (👍 1): Bragging? You presumed that I wasn't bilingual, and I simply refuted your shitty hypothesis. If anyone here's bragging, it would be you, but that's not the point. 

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

**EnvironmentRich214** (👍 31): Oh you are a teacher? Name every student in the world. /s

**Aliensinnoh** (👍 34): Class moms work if you live in a relatively privileged area. Though parents fundraising can easily morph into a district underfunding all schools and only the rich neighborhoods get fundraising. Ultimately in the US funding needs to be moved to the state level to break the back of unequal schooling.

  ↳ **jcutta** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 18): Oh yeah, it's absolutely a mark of a privileged area. My town is considered poor compared to the town we border but we're definitely upper middle, median home price is somewhere close to $400k, and median income is something like $175k household.

I think state funding would be great, but I want to see the poorer areas be increased and the more well off areas stay steady. I pay a shit load of taxes to have my kids well educated and I don't want them to be handicapped to meet some arbitrary common ground. Bring everyone up to the higher standards rather than lower the standards across the board. I also think teaching should be a 6 figure job not $50-60k or much less depending on district.

  ↳ **TragedyPornFamilyVid** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 3): Yup.  My hometown has fabulous schools, funded through property tax.

The state redirects some of the funds to support impoverished districts, but the end result is a school that's 80 to 90 % kids from 6-figure households in a low cost of living state and kids from the one apartment complex that aims to rent to illegal immigrants, because they're easier to extort and steal from.

People resist equalizing funding, because most of the people in the high quality school districts moved there for the schools.  You have families that could afford to have a nice house and short commute in a different suburb with shitty schools or a nasty 2 bedroom apartment with a predatory landlord in a district where every teacher has a master's degree and a good portion have their Ph.d.

They're going to see it as selfish behavior by the people who chose to put building equity over their kids' education and now want the benefits of both without voting to raise their own taxes to fund it.

    ↳ **Aliensinnoh** 回复 TragedyPornFamilyVid (👍 3): Part of it is presumably schools funded at the state level would be funded through income taxes rather than property taxes. So suddenly all the towns spending half their budget on schools will be able to slash their property taxes while the state raises income taxes on everyone.

      ↳ **jcutta** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 2): Someone could hand NJ enough money to fund schools for the rest of time and they still would raise property taxes every year.

      ↳ **TragedyPornFamilyVid** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 1): Texas doesn't have an income tax.

Everything is funded through property tax or sales tax. As a result, they passed the "Robinhood act" to redistribute funds to poorer school districts.

For example,  between 2014 and 2018 Austin ISD increased taxes collected for education from about $700 million to almost $1200 million, but the budget for their school district remained stagnant.

The local residents could vote to double their taxes again, but they wouldn't be able to give their local schools any additional funds.  Those would be recaptured by the state. More than half of Austin ISD's students are "economically disadvantaged" and about quarter need ESL classes, but the land is valuable, so the district has to give money away to district with lower property values.

It's made them the icon of people who oppose that law, but the truth is that the state is obligated to provide an education to everyone.  If people don't want an income tax, this is the alternative.

**hungryhograt** (👍 2): I usually get an assortment of sweets, I bring drinks and snacks, sometimes we make things, sometimes we just watch a movie (it all depends on the class and what they choose to do collectively). Kids are encouraged to bring things to share but it’s not compulsory. The problem comes in with having 6-7 different classes (depending on the day). But I justify spending the money by telling myself that it’s only once a year and it’s a lot of fun for the kids

This was a long time ago (hopefully this kind of behavior is no longer tolerated in schools) and I'm sure the guy was dealing with a lot of personal issues of one kind or another.

There was another kid in my class who was genuinely a very good artist, certainly put me to shame and he always got an A, and deserved that A.  And there was one other kid who couldn’t care less about art and always got a D.

One morning before art class we three decided to do an experiment.  Those two other kids swapped homework and signed each other’s.

Sure enough, the talented kid still got an A and the other kid still got a D.  None of tried after that, if the teacher didn’t care why should we?  It killed my passion for art.

Pretty sure the teacher probably just found out what y'all did and graded y'all for the work you actually did. If y'all had been in the class doing assignments for that long it probably wasn't hard to figure out. 

But I feel ya, I had an art teacher when I was in 2nd grade erase a self portrait I'd done while standing overtop of me telling me how I'd done it all "wrong". Killed my passion for drawing at a young age.

    ↳ **LethalSalad** 回复 DTSportsNow (👍 4): That'd be pretty bad teaching if they wouldn't even have mentioned it to the kids. The only thing they'd do is make the kids think they didn't actually check it. (Which, according to OP, was exactly what happened)

      ↳ **KeepCalm-ShutUp** 回复 Rokurokubi83 (👍 3): My philosophy for art has always been "I don't know what I'm doing, I don't care whether or not it's right, I care even less what you think of it (but praise is appreciated), this is still good enough for me."

Maybe that'll rekindle your interest, but I doubt it.

    ↳ **Pete_Booty_Judge** 回复 AsherGray (👍 1): Take this with a huge grain of salt that I know only a very entry level bit of Spanish and French, but my experience with those languages at least is that their singular, possessive references really aren’t that ambiguous as they are still gendered.  

I’m more than ok with American English (I can’t speak to what other English speaking countries are doing) using plural pronouns to maintain ambiguity, as I think the context is even easier to spot in many cases as to whether or not you’re talking about a singular entity or a plural one, compared to figuring out whether or not “il” or “el” is gendered or ambiguous.  

I do think that English speakers should be more forgiving towards ESL speakers as I do honestly believe our language is a very difficult one to master and I have great respect for anyone that has bothered to learn it better than my own feeble attempts at foreign languages.

  ↳ **MilledGears** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I know in highschool English class we were thought that although using "they" is nicer when referring to someone of unspecified gender, using "it" is grammatically correct.

It is worth noting this was over a decade ago and language changes with time. When I was taught this gender was still considered interchangeable with sex and gender identity wasn't a prevalent topic.

      ↳ **MilledGears** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I guess so, we were also taught to refer to animals by "it", if "it" is only meant for inanimate things I figure referring to animals with "it" would be wrong.

      ↳ **tubelesssquid88** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Yeah I've had them before. But I feel and this is my opinion from an ith grader, that teachers are WAAAY underplayed. Honestly I believe you deserve more money than what you make

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 tubelesssquid88 (👍 4): Thanks! Well, being underappreciated can kill the teacher spark. And the kids deserve to have teachers who are actually content with their career choice.

As for the money, I agree, my wallet agrees, too. Luckily, I live in a relatively inexpensive country and a small town. So it's not that bad.

So this online instruction... easy peasy.  Not for others around my age.

    ↳ **pinacoladablackbird** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Same! Although I fear that the kids think I'm just desperately trying to be cool and relatable when I talk about memes and games etc. when it's just my lack of maturity at the grand age of 32.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): The joys of working in the public sector! Although with COVID and all, I must say I was definitely more at ease about my employment than the private sector.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): Sometimes it is possible, but the budget is so tight that you generally have to choose between doing something at your own expense or not doing it at all. I teach English as a foreign language and, believe you me, there's no price I wouldn't pay to see a bunch of 18-year-olds play shop for 45 minutes. (I printed out the money, bought stickers, school supplies, fruit, what not, and they spent the whole class taking turns at the check out and practising shopping dialogues. It was fun. At some point I was not necessary in the classroom almost, they took the role play into their own hands).

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Oh, come on. I know it's not practical. But I guess I needed that appreciation. There's a saying, not a very common one, but it fits. An appreciated teacher doesn't bark at their students.

Edit.  Pronoun.

  ↳ **Burt__Macklin__FBI2** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Oh, feel appreciated. It's not directed at you, or your enjoyment out of it. That's cool. 

I'm just saying for people willing to throw cash around after your post could find a lot better and meaningful ways to spend it (educational charities, etc) versus sticking it in the pocket of lifelong loser, Steve Huffman reddit CEO

**[deleted]** (👍 2): Yeah, painting rooms, decorating them, school supplies, access to educational websites, some prizes, private unpaid time at the weekend (apart from tests and class preparation), training courses ( I'm required by law to advance and train). Aaaaall that jazz;) 
Teachers of this world are united by one more thing!

**[deleted]** (👍 1): I don't get that much off. 6 weeks over the summer, 2 weeks in winter, a week at christmas, a week at easter. Still more than most people, what can I say, I love this time off,  It would be lovely though if I could take a day off during the school year for dental emergencies, doctor visits, etc. I don't need so much time off in the summr, id rather work as usual. It's the students that do.

  ↳ **QueenRhaenys** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Oh ok. You must not work at a US public school. I just assumed, sorry. Every public school in the US lets out in mid May or mid June (depending on where in the country). If mid May, they go back in mid August. If mid June, sometime around Labor Day. 

Still, I would love to have six straight weeks in a row off. I work at a nonprofit and am also “underpaid”...in fact I probably get paid less than most teachers and work 30% more but that is my choice.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 QueenRhaenys (👍 3): That's ok. I've got to tell you that those 6 weeks are both a blessing and a curse. It takes me two weeks to unwind, because the end of the school year is mad with paperwork. And suddenly, with the last day of school,  there's nothing I have to do. It's like running around headless, no rhyme or reason. But at some point I can really rest. And I have no problem with my own kids in the summer.

      ↳ **QueenRhaenys** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That’s nice! I can see it being a blessing and a curse

**[deleted]** (👍 27): I know there is:) I've done my share of different jobs. I know for sure that self employment is much riskier and you put much more of yourself in it.
But I feel like being a teacher is seen as a comfy job where you do nothing. Well, wrong. You carry the workload, the emotional load, yours and that of others.   Have you ever tried doing it? What's your experience?

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -39): [deleted]

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 16): We're probably too sensitive, I guess. And you're right that teachers tend to tell people how hard they work. Idk, in the jobs that I did before becoming a teacher, no one told me to my face that my job is idk too easy, or my profession is for lazy people. I've been told numerous times that teachers earn too much for the job they do. I find it difficult to digest and maybe become defensive because I live my job, I get totally immersed in it, you know, with zeal. And seeing disbelief when somebody asks me what I'm doing at 8 pm and I say I'm working is a little unnerving.

But, well, what can you do. I still love it. I know there are teachers who are dumbasses, lazy gits or idiots. And I'm trying to do my job best I can.

    ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 agent_raconteur (👍 1): Well I do wish there was a distinct word, because I hate the idea of using the same word to refer to a group of people and one person without gender specified. It seems like a real flaw in the English language, but it works for now and it is more personable than "it".

        ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): Yeah I saw Oxford or somebody added the singular they to the dictionary last year and was [like](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/710/dd0.png), haven't we been doing that the whole time?

          ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): we have been! but a lot of transphobic people were like “wahhh it’s not in the dictionary that means it doesn’t exist” so oxford added it in iirc

            ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): SOO many older people I know are hung up on thinking that language is derived from the dictionary instead of the other way around. Probably what they were taught in school 50 years ago so a hard mental construct to break. 

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

              ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): the definition of -phobia is a fear *or aversion* and yet it’s so ignored lol

                ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

  ↳ **holdingmytongue** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): This also is why I’ll never be comfortable calling someone ‘it’, even if it is their chosen pronoun.  Gender neutral terminology aside-‘it’ sounds so inhuman and derogatory. 
I will do whatever mental gymnastics is required to avoid calling you that.

**DouchNozzle_REAL** (👍 9): Yes but the more appropriate term would be "their".


If I were to call a person an "it" I'm almost referring to them as property or as an object. The usage of "it" is dehumanizing. 



"It" is more acceptable when you say something like "it's a boy!" Or "it's me!".

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 DouchNozzle_REAL (👍 1): Actually, "his/her" is gramatically correct, as weird as it may sound. Their suggests a plural possesive, and op is refering to a singular person

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): No, English has used "their" as a gender neutral singular forever. The idea that it this isn't proper English is a lot like the "split infinitives" rule or "never end with a preposition" rule. In that you hear people claim it is a rule but it's not actually a rule of standard English.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Then why did i learn it in english class my nib

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Because there are a lot of “traditionalists” who learned those so-called rules and then also teach them. And there are also a certain group of language prescriptivists who think they ought to be considered formal rules.

"Do not use "their" as an alternative to his or her; "their" should be used only when referring to a plural subject. Each of the rules here offers a method of avoiding gender-based language."

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

    ↳ **DouchNozzle_REAL** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): While you're correct, in this day and age using "his/her" isn't as socially acceptable when *we don't know the gender of the person we are referring to*.

  ↳ **MamaBear_07** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Not insulting at all. I am in the bay area and I work in a school that has 90% tech parents so they expect a lot more than games and recess. All we do is learning there. I actually feel bad for the kids because they don’t get much play and if they get any of their paperwork wrong parents come to me asking why. And if you have a bachelors in early childhood education You get the same amount of education as elementary teachers do. I am overqualified for my position. And the thing that makes me laugh the most is a lot of preschool teacher positions in the Phoenix area require a bachelors degrees yet they only want to pay $13 an hour

    ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 cityofbrotherlyhate (👍 2): We don’t go to school to learn how to do our job. We go to school to learn how to learn to do our job. You’re basically asserting that a teacher should make more than me because they needed more initial schooling when in fact I had to spend much more time learning through apprenticeship then they did in class.

They don’t usually go to school to learn the material they teach unless they’re teaching at a college level. They go to school to learn how to manage children in groups.

Me on the other hand, I am qualified to teach my trade at the college level and I have held positions as a trainer for apprenticeships at more than one company.

**If_you_ban_me_I_win** (👍 1): Do less is right. I remember when the local paper published the listed teacher salaries. The highest paid teacher was my history teacher and to this day I can’t tell you a single thing about history from his class but I can tell you the story of how he met his wife and got married along with other irrelevant shit.

That’s about 53,000 a teacher is paid 60,000 however, a teacher teaches. A police officer has deal with criminals and basically every part of the job isn’t safe. So in terms of a job they should be paid more.

**[deleted]** (👍 5): We aren't doing too great. There is so much division and spreading of misinformation that everybody is confused and irritable and people are slowly retracting more and more into their political groups.

  ↳ **assistanmanager** 回复 [deleted] (👍 6): If you truly think we are in anything close to a “cold digital civil war” then perhaps you should take some time off social media and realize how far from the truth that actually is.

Although some teachers do work their students too hard and while not always the case, there have been a few teachers ice had that don’t seem to realize that kids and teens can be utter dicks without meaning to. Which is why some of my favorite teachers are the ones that never shout or scold the students and take the time to be understanding.

        ↳ **BanthaMilk** 回复 god_avocado (👍 2): the reason everyone on reddit thinks the same is because no one is allowed to have their own opinion, thanks to the almighty downvote. we've literally had to create a subreddit called unpopular opinion just so people can share their general personal thoughts and ideas without being downvoted to oblivion and losing all their karma to a comment which includes an opinion that is not generally accepted by people. reddit literally has almost no freedom of speech because of this platform's nature to get into arguments about the smallest things e.g. I was in a discussion and I mentioned something about how Ancient Rome had freedom of religion and this guy replied to me saying "wHaT aBoUt ThE pErSeCuTiOn Of ChRiStIaNs?!?!?".

        ↳ **chabbleor** 回复 god_avocado (👍 1): I love sea food, with the exception of shrimp. I thought, "shrimp is the most basic sea food there is, so if I love sea food, I must love shrimp." So every time I go out with friends or whoever and get dinner, if shrimp is on the menu in some dish, I order it. But every time so far, I have not enjoyed it at all and ended up regretting ordering the shrimp soup or whatever. My friends now question my love of sea food.

  ↳ **Def_Not_Alt_Acct** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 42): I had this one teacher in middle school who was an 80 year old irish lad.

**Clumsy_Chica** (👍 105): I so wish I could remember my fifth grade teacher's first name... It was close to 20 years ago but he was the one who kickstartred my love of science by having us do about 400% more science projects (poster board and all...) than any other fifth grade class that year.  

I threw a soccer ball at his face once when we were playing at recess and he put me in timeout, I was dealing with a lot of shit at home and wasn't processing my anger at all.  I really badly want to apologize, and thank him, but it's been so long and I can't seem to find him :(

  ↳ **YourTypicalBoss** 回复 Clumsy_Chica (👍 61): Honestly there’s certain things I want to get off my chest to certain teachers too. I never did anything like throwing a ball into a teacher’s face, but as a class we badgered the fuck out of a lot of teachers, particularly a really old Christian brother who (ironically) taught science. Because of his age we messed with him a lot (some really funny shit ngl but nonetheless cruel), but I know at least 3 guys who majored in a science field in college because of him.

    ↳ **Mysterious_Lesions** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 22): In our school, there was a tonne of badgering of the bus driver as well. It would be totally unacceptable to do this for a public transit driver.

But luckily all my other teachers are pretty nice and understanding.

But I'm glad she is. I think now, more than ever, kids need a kind guiding hand, and she fit the bill perfectly. Real sweet old grandmotherly type.

**Silfurstar** (👍 3): The best part of the job for me was always past students getting in touch and bringing up events, situations or even details that I had forgotten but that they remembered because it meant something to them.

I still stopped teaching last year. In part because I have another career I want to focus on, but mostly because of too many times coming home broken and discouraged. I wanted to keep teaching at least one or two days a week, but I just couldn't handle it anymore.

I'm hoping this break will allow me to come back to it in some form in the future.

**kaaaaath** (👍 3): I also like to do this to teacher who were evil to me.

My first day of college I was in OChem and my AP Chem teacher was my professor. When we had to take actual roll that one day she was like “your name sounds so familiar!” And I was like “...that’s because you told me last year I wouldn’t even go to college, Mrs. Resler.”

**[deleted]** (👍 2): I added a lot of my old teachers (the ones I liked anyway) as friends on FB/LinkedIn. Initially it was as a reference, admittedly, but after a while of getting to know them it turns out the same people who I used to think were annoying for keeping me inside during lunch and making me stay after school were actually really cool people that were just looking out for their student's best interest. I still talk regularly with my freshman year science teacher for example, and my old IT teacher (I went to tech school instead of a traditional high school) provided priceless information for navigating college as a CS student during my first year. I was extremely lucky to have great teachers and I appreciate them a lot for the foundation they gave me and for showing me that there can be joy in learning.

**Sunny_yet_rainy** (👍 1): This year, which was my first year out of homeschool, i had decided to email all my teachers at the end of the year saying thank you and had emailed a drawing of said teacher i had made.

**spooner248** (👍 1): It also feels awesome to let a teacher know this. It lets you reflect on how far you’ve come and how you had some good role models in the past. It’s a win-win

**fullmetalmerlin** (👍 1): So true and incredibly important!

**[deleted]** (👍 1): My dad's teacher in primary school was an artist, she would have the class draw three lines and turn them into different drawings, she turned my dad's into a genie. Years later my dad got his first tattoo, that genie. He got into contact with the teachers daughter and when he tried to show that teacher she yelled at him and told him to leave.

  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Was the tattoo on his ass?

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): No, its on his back and its giant, takes up his whole back

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Yeah, if a dude started to remove his shirt at me, I'd probably shut that down quick too

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Uhm, why do you have to assume it was like that? I don't appreciate you assuming such a thing about my father. Literally just a dude who thought someone's custom art for him was good enough to get it tattooed onto him. And why did you assume it was on his ass?

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Also her problem wasn't him being shirtless it was that he got it tattooed onto him

            ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That could be support creepy, she might've thought his sincere gesture was showing obsessive stalker tendencies, you don't know her life lol jeez, why yell at me for it?

          ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): The ass part was obviously a joke, and everything I said was gleaned from finding a rational explanation for your description of her reaction. Calm your chodes.

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Chode* I'm pretty calm. If what you said what a joke congrats, to me it came off as sorta condescending.

              ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Trying to see another person's perspective shouldn't seem like a condescending thing.

**DaksTheDaddyNow** (👍 1): That would fuel me for years. 

I taught a fourth grader to read my first year. It's my greatest achievement as a teacher. I hope he's doing well, it's only been a couple of years.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Bruh. In my country it‘s illegal to chat online with your teacher or have their number

**pixlkiss** (👍 1): This makes me so happy. I've had a drunken night or two where I emailed teachers from high school and expressed regret for skipping class and assignments, and told them how they made an impact in my life and what I'm doing now. I send a good message drunk; nothing emotional or weird. But when I wake up the morning after I always regret it and feel like they're probably like "Yeah you sucked". Now I'm really glad I sent them.

**KDawG888** (👍 1): > Thank you for everything you did, I'm sorry I was an utter shit.

The teachers I disrespected I usually did so because I didn't like them. I wouldn't reach out to them. I'd reach out to a teacher I liked who showed mutual respect (or at least pretended to)

There are good teachers but there are also plenty bad ones.

  ↳ **OverlordWaffles** 回复 KDawG888 (👍 2): Yeah, I've only done it once, and it was for a college teacher. 

The teachers I were disrespectful to were the ones that repeatedly did so to me. I heard recently of one that was a complete asshole 24/7 was then working at a gas station near where I worked and I really wanted to go in there and give him a hard time. I didn't end up going though

**alexalex19921992** (👍 1): Not true. Do ur job you have students thanking u. I was a pos until I got this teacher who wasn’t having it. I wouldn’t be an attorney without him being s good teacher rather than a lazy bum.

**guess_its_me_** (👍 5): Well from a student: tell her thanks for putting up with all the bullshit of the system as well as the students, we may not always be the Best But good teachers make us want to be better!

**K-leb25** (👍 2): I love the kinds of teachers you can keep in touch with after school.

**laughingashley** (👍 2): Sometimes toxic people don't "come around" to better habits, unfortunately. Even if they're family, it's often just more of the same when your growth alone isn't enough.

  ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): It wasn't even a toxic relationship between me and them. We kind of just stopped talking. I don't think my parents were very fond of them, but that's about the only reason. When I was younger, the only time we ever really saw them was when someone was dying.

    ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 Jackal7112 (👍 2): Oh, well then maybe you should reach out! I had a similar situation in my fam, but after I tried to reestablish communication, she didn't even bother responding so.... my advice is to try, but keep expectations low lol

      ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): I might just do that. Thank you kind internet stranger.

  ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): You assume they no longer talk because of one side being nasty when more often it's just because people drift apart and change their social priorities.

**guess_its_me_** (👍 2): Well I might not be your student, but I’d still like to thank you for teaching despite how under appreciated your job goes, the world would really be a darker place without teachers like you!

    ↳ **msndrstdmstrmnd** 回复 WubbaLubbaDubStep (👍 7): Have you even seen teachers salaries? And in addition a lot of teachers pay for a ton of their classroom’s supplies out of pocket because of such low funding for schools. A lot of teachers work two or three jobs because their teaching salary alone can’t sustain them

That's still an awful lot for a teacher to just spend out of pocket when they're paid shit and have to bring their own personal supplies into school.

    ↳ **czs5056** 回复 cavemaneca (👍 23): Obviously pizza won't cost $1000, but I wanted to throw a figure out there that would allow a person to buy 30 some odd pizzas at a time and not think twice about it.

    ↳ **czs5056** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 8): It's not 1k for pizza, it's 1k of money that can be spent on anything after paying bills. Since this is being done at the school we need to assume that it's hot pizza being delivered not frozen unless the school is going to allow the teacher to use an oven in the kitchen

**communistcrusaders** (👍 20): This has to be a troll, look at his posts and comments. What kind of real person posts that shit?

**ImKindaBoring** (👍 6): A) they're not talking about 1 pizza they're most likely talking about 20+, maybe even 30+.

B) teachers aren't paid minimum wage or anything but you certainly aren't getting wealthy as a teacher. Many of my teachers needed a second job to keep up with normal bills.

C) the comment you responded to was quite obviously hyperbole. Get better at reading comprehension.

  ↳ **Hazardish08** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 2): Also the fact that a lot of teachers have families meaning some 50-60k a year doesn’t seem that much and they will run low on cash a few times.

  ↳ **LethalSalad** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 1): Still, around 30 cheap pizzas would be like 60 bucks, that's pretty doable for a once-a-year thing or something. She sounds like one of those good teachers who genuinely enjoy their students' happiness, so that would be pretty worth it.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 2): I don't think you couldn't find 30 pizzas for 60 bucks for a school party. Even at the grocery store, if you could get 30 of their cheapest pizzas it would most likely still be more than $60. I don't recall ever seeing a full pizza for less than 2 bucks. This school would also have to have a bunch of large ovens that are available for use (which they very well could). 

Getting them delivered is really the only reasonable way to have 30 pizzas all ready to eat at the same time.

Edit: just my thoughts, I'm no pizza party planning expert

    ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 0): Where you finding $2 pizzas? Would probably be more like $150 which can be a sizable amount for someone living paycheck to paycheck as many teachers do. But, again, the key takeaway is the comment was hyperbolic, it isn't meant to be taken literally.

    ↳ **jcutta** 回复 PayMeInSteak (👍 1): You tried vaping? It's the only thing that ever worked for me. It's so stupidly demonized now but it was a God send for me to get off tobacco.

      ↳ **PayMeInSteak** 回复 jcutta (👍 1): I do have a vape. It's the only thing that actually helps me with the quit portion of the cycle. 

I have a lot of friends that smoke too so that's the REALLY hard part. They have no plans on quitting. Lol

        ↳ **jcutta** 回复 PayMeInSteak (👍 1): I've been mostly off cigs for almost a decade (I still smoke when I go to like all inclusives lol) but being around smokers still gets me hardcore wanting to light up.

Try using nic salts if you haven't. Any tobacco tastes like shit to me now when I use them.

**dwefgert354** (👍 38): Big oof

**Samsuxx** (👍 7): That's not true.

Or let met put it this way: teachers everywhere are underpaid.

  ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 Samsuxx (👍 17): ok let me rephrase aswell:  
In germany teachers arent underpaid to a point where they even struggle to survive on 2 jobs.

    ↳ **Samsuxx** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 6): Lol do American teachers?

Sorry, I didn't mean to go all ACKSHUALLY on you, I was just venting some frustration having worked with teachers in Germany.

    ↳ **HazelnitBoyyy** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): A good part of America pays their teachers atleast decently. Where Im from, the teachers start at around 60k and make around 100k a year by the end. Plus, teachers get more time off than most jobs (not justifying them getting paid too little, im just saying it isnt as bad as it seems)

      ↳ **Aggravating-Abroad44** 回复 HazelnitBoyyy (👍 1): There’s more jobs that don’t pay than do. My wife’s been a teacher at 4 locations in Ohio and still makes half of what her pay should be. She has 10 years of experience. The problem with teaching is that you rarely get hired for experience but because your family. I’ve seen people sub for a decade and still not get hired when a spot opens.

  ↳ **gojirra** 回复 Samsuxx (👍 2): I get your point,  that all teachers everywhere deserve more. Honestly yes, bless them, but some societies actually do value teachers and pay them fair wages.

**Yog-S0th0th** (👍 2): I dunno.    30.4 cents per kilowatt hour and 5.50$ gasoline in germany.   Still seems underpaid to me.

  ↳ **The_Daddelbox** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 5): 5,50?
Petrol's 2,17-1,50€ per litre

    ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): I'm comparing to America since thats what the underpaid teacher salary is about.    And. I'm comparing here gallons vs germany in gallons.   There's about 3.7 liters in a gallon and every euro is about 1.18 USD   If then compared to here that teacher in germany is essentially paying 6.49 USD to 9.47 USD per gallon of gas.   Or gas is around 1.89 in most places with California being one of the highest by far at 3.27.

I'm just saying its still seems like tewchee get underpaid in general when compared to cost of living in a lot of places.

  ↳ **gojirra** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 5): Ok oil subsidy lobbyist. Imagine trying to guess the cost of living based on gas and electricity alone lol.

    ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 gojirra (👍 1): Imagine not taking that into account at all.  LOL

  ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 Yog-S0th0th (👍 2): But 1. You don't need to drive as far as in the USA and 2. Stuff like rent is cheaper over here, as long as you don't live in the top 5 cities.

    ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 KingBellmann (👍 1): "You don't need to drive as far in the US?" Pff, ok. People here drive over an hour to get to work, as a general minimum, so I don't know your frame of reference here. I've always had to leave at LEAST an hour before my shift in all of the places I've lived or worked. My mom does the same. The United States are vastly spread out, with most states being filled with farm lands and ranches, meaning "town" is further away from homes. Even in cities, though, it takes forever to get anywhere because of congestion and traffic and construction. I can't think of any experience where I didn't work pretty far from where I lived unless I was in high school. Even when I worked in LA, a ton of my coworkers drove to their jobs from Palmdale or Lancaster, even Santa Clarita isn't very close.

How the f far are you driving in Germany to reach this conclusion, and why would anyone drive further than that?? I'm totally amazed if it's further!

      ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 laughingashley (👍 5): I said that germans do NOT drive as far and much as Americans, therefore we don't need as much fuel and higher fuel prices hurt less...

        ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 KingBellmann (👍 1): Ah, my mistake. I was truly astounded lol

  ↳ **SpiderFlame04** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): That’s better than my middle school in Kansas. Most of the teachers were giving kids an extra credit point to buy a box of Kleenex for them because there wasn’t any class funds budget.

    ↳ **akatherder** 回复 SpiderFlame04 (👍 2): It's standard in our kids' elementary school that every kid brings in some ziploc bags, tissue, hand sanitizer, etc. during the first week.  It's part of the "School supplies list."  Then the teacher makes it available to everyone throughout the year.  We're a upper-middle class suburb.

      ↳ **SpiderFlame04** 回复 akatherder (👍 2): I get that, but you’d think they’d give free tissues to an eighth grade class

**PostsOnGamedesign** (👍 1): Would you actually being comfortable paying tax money to fund pizzas?

  ↳ **AsymmetricPanda** 回复 PostsOnGamedesign (👍 2): Yes, if it’s just leftover budget that was assigned to teachers for class supplies. Some of teacher salary comes from taxes and they probably spend some of it on pizza anyway

Being hormonal isn't an excuse for boys to fight or rape. Being hormonal isn't an excuse for girls to cheat or be irrational.

      ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 ComplainyGuy (👍 17): I agree but those are learned behaviours. Sometimes instincts win over education. 

Still doesn't justify it though, just trying to explain it.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LiarsFearTruth (👍 11): [deleted]

          ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 17): Because the overwhelming majority of people are anti science and anti-intellectualism. 

Just bring up how faith is a form of superstition and you'll get bullied and mocked, by the same people who say are anti-bullying. 

People only like "wholesome" and "positive" science. 

Anything too real and the cognitive dissonance beats out their reason. These are all well known and recorded psychological interactions

    ↳ **It_Calls_to_You** 回复 [deleted] (👍 6): But we aren't wild animals?.. It seems like you're just trying to make a "profound" statement.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 It_Calls_to_You (👍 13): The guy he’s replying to said he didn’t understand why people cheat, the other guy was trying to express the dichotomy of our animalistic nature vs our self-awareness and intelligence relative to other creatures, this awareness can make animalistic things like cheating, fighting, murder, rape etc. seem unexplainable and horrible when they’re common in nature. I don’t think he was trying to be /r/iamverysmart he was just trying to comment on the guy who said he didn’t understand why people cheat

        ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Exactly. You nailed it. 


Even horrible "crimes" (we decided they are crimes) like murder and cannibalism and rape are just normal survival evolutionary behaviors in nature. 

We created society and its rules but our instincts are still there, waiting under the outer shell of civility.

      ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 It_Calls_to_You (👍 6): I'm saying the distinction between wild and not wild is arbitrary and made up by humans to distinguish ourselves from all other life. 


Scientifically speaking,  we are all just animals. There is no distinction.


Which explains the behaviour of our most savage members.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 27): But atleast it isnt behind their back and you arent betraying someone

      ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -6): Trust me, if you tell someone you are leaving because you want to date someone else, they will react just as badly, if not worse, than if you are caught cheating.

        ↳ **ZombieDonShula** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 15): So if they're both the same than do the more ethical one?

          ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 ZombieDonShula (👍 -9): My ethics are based on minimization of harm.

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 12): Then adhere to your ethics. Minimization of harm would be to break up with your partner vs. cheating on them. Idiot.

              ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): No, it would be to keep them from finding out, that way they aren't made unhappy.

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 7): Or, you could be honest so they could break up with your toxic ass and they can move on to someone who will treat them right.

        ↳ **jsthd** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 7): Lets say you’re right about that, the problem is that you're wasting your and your partner's life. Let them be truly happy, don't be an a*s

**Fireverse** (👍 3): And I mean... If your husband's father just died, wait a little to cheat again or idk, be more discrete about it (I know I sound like I'm vouching for cheaters which I absolutely am not, they're one of the worst scums in the universe, I'm just saying that maybe if there's a chance of someone finding out you're cheating on them, maybe try and make it happen not right after their dad's death).

**DazzlerPlus** (👍 2): Not just with anyone, but with someone whose entire job it is to humiliate you, second guess and criticize you, steal from you, and waste your time

**woosterthunkit** (👍 2): I was talking to another redditor really as friends and he gaslit me good, then I realised he'd prob gotten alot on practice when cheating on his now ex wife

**QuartzPuffyStar** (👍 3): > Thats why I don't understand cheaters 

People love differently , different people and for a different time. People also get horny with other people. People also get bored, lazy and don't know how to communicate. Some people just can't have one partner.  


Only one of those can be reason enough to cheat. 

Usually people go with a couple. 

Life is complex, love is complex, or it is made that way by the simplified expectations  and hopes that culture embeds in people since early ages.

  ↳ **Suekru** 回复 QuartzPuffyStar (👍 3): Then leave your partner. The only time “cheating”
Is acceptable is perhaps the cheater is in an abusive relationship and can’t leave at the moment.

But even then I’d advise against it for their safety if their SO is abusive.

  ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 QuartzPuffyStar (👍 1): That's why I think people should only marry if they've been together for _several_ years and are _100%_ sure they've met their soul mate and BFF.

I reckon the cultural perception should shift from being so focused on having a partner for life (especially in countries with less and less people having kids) and instead be more communal, if that makes sense. Don't focus on loving one person but understand you may love multiple.

**cityofbrotherlyhate** (👍 2): Cheating is obviously wrong but everyone has terrible and heartbreaking stuff happen to them (including sometimes cheating) and only a minuscule amount of people are so unable to handle these trials that they turn to one of the most selfish methods of coping, suicide. I'm willing to bet that in most cases where suicide comes as a result of problems that the person can't control, there's probably previous mental problems (or sometimes physical problems) that the person has been dealing with. To totally blame a cheating spouse for a person's suicide seems short sighted to me

    ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 30): Canada. 80-84 = A- / 85-89 = A / 90+ = A+

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 9): Ye then that A- is more equivalent to a B+ or a B in systems where there's no A+.

Not a bad grade by any means, just looks better than it is when you're used to A- being really close to perfect.

        ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 7): Not necessarily though, because while the US system is designed in such a way that getting an A is possible through hard work, other countries have systems where getting the equivalent is simply not really a realistic goal. The tests are designed so that effectively everyone makes mistakes, getting even 90 percent right can mean that you are good at the subject, smart in general, and working very hard - anything less and lower grades are usual. I don't know if it's the case in Canada as well, but I think it's possible that that is why they changed the numbers for the letter grades.

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 8): At LSE in London I remember something like a 60% was an A lol. The tests were much harder though..

            ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): Yeah exactly! It sounds really strange to Americans usually, but I've lived in the US and in Europe and the tests in Europe are just way harder overal!

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

                ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 2): Really? Where I live getting 90-93 is considered an A- and 80-84 would be a D+ (assuming A+ to D- scale). Our 75 is an F ):

        ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's rough. F here is anything under 50. With 50s being Ds, 60s Cs, 70s Bs, and 80+ As.

    ↳ **xLaZi3x** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 2): A good bit of Universities do a 10 point system especially technical or STEM schools.

      ↳ **ScumlordAzazel** 回复 xLaZi3x (👍 1): The grading scale at my university was different depending on the subject. Most were 10 or but basic engineering courses were 93 and up as an A and the really hard 0hysics classes had like 85 and up as an A.

I also know Canada secondary schools have different grading scales depending on the province. Can't remember what it was for post-secondary schools because I was only calculating US equivalent GPAs at my last job for secondary schools. India has grading scales where you pass so long as it's above a 34. 34 to 44 would be a D.

Also, most US high schools use the 10 pt scale.

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

**jcutta** (👍 18): Oh yeah, it's absolutely a mark of a privileged area. My town is considered poor compared to the town we border but we're definitely upper middle, median home price is somewhere close to $400k, and median income is something like $175k household.

I think state funding would be great, but I want to see the poorer areas be increased and the more well off areas stay steady. I pay a shit load of taxes to have my kids well educated and I don't want them to be handicapped to meet some arbitrary common ground. Bring everyone up to the higher standards rather than lower the standards across the board. I also think teaching should be a 6 figure job not $50-60k or much less depending on district.

**TragedyPornFamilyVid** (👍 3): Yup.  My hometown has fabulous schools, funded through property tax.

The state redirects some of the funds to support impoverished districts, but the end result is a school that's 80 to 90 % kids from 6-figure households in a low cost of living state and kids from the one apartment complex that aims to rent to illegal immigrants, because they're easier to extort and steal from.

People resist equalizing funding, because most of the people in the high quality school districts moved there for the schools.  You have families that could afford to have a nice house and short commute in a different suburb with shitty schools or a nasty 2 bedroom apartment with a predatory landlord in a district where every teacher has a master's degree and a good portion have their Ph.d.

They're going to see it as selfish behavior by the people who chose to put building equity over their kids' education and now want the benefits of both without voting to raise their own taxes to fund it.

  ↳ **Aliensinnoh** 回复 TragedyPornFamilyVid (👍 3): Part of it is presumably schools funded at the state level would be funded through income taxes rather than property taxes. So suddenly all the towns spending half their budget on schools will be able to slash their property taxes while the state raises income taxes on everyone.

    ↳ **jcutta** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 2): Someone could hand NJ enough money to fund schools for the rest of time and they still would raise property taxes every year.

    ↳ **TragedyPornFamilyVid** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 1): Texas doesn't have an income tax.

Everything is funded through property tax or sales tax. As a result, they passed the "Robinhood act" to redistribute funds to poorer school districts.

For example,  between 2014 and 2018 Austin ISD increased taxes collected for education from about $700 million to almost $1200 million, but the budget for their school district remained stagnant.

The local residents could vote to double their taxes again, but they wouldn't be able to give their local schools any additional funds.  Those would be recaptured by the state. More than half of Austin ISD's students are "economically disadvantaged" and about quarter need ESL classes, but the land is valuable, so the district has to give money away to district with lower property values.

It's made them the icon of people who oppose that law, but the truth is that the state is obligated to provide an education to everyone.  If people don't want an income tax, this is the alternative.

Pretty sure the teacher probably just found out what y'all did and graded y'all for the work you actually did. If y'all had been in the class doing assignments for that long it probably wasn't hard to figure out. 

But I feel ya, I had an art teacher when I was in 2nd grade erase a self portrait I'd done while standing overtop of me telling me how I'd done it all "wrong". Killed my passion for drawing at a young age.

**Shanakitty** (👍 6): I get the frustration. I had an art teacher one year who gave me an 87 on every single assignment I turned in. But I mean, if they'd been teaching you guys for a couple of years, they probably knew what your drawing styles looked like.

**AsherGray** (👍 1): It's kind of crazy how English doesn't have an ambiguous, singular, possessive reference. Obviously, Americans have started using they/them/theirs as the inclusive reference, but technically only applicable to multiple people over one individual.

  ↳ **Pete_Booty_Judge** 回复 AsherGray (👍 1): Take this with a huge grain of salt that I know only a very entry level bit of Spanish and French, but my experience with those languages at least is that their singular, possessive references really aren’t that ambiguous as they are still gendered.  

I’m more than ok with American English (I can’t speak to what other English speaking countries are doing) using plural pronouns to maintain ambiguity, as I think the context is even easier to spot in many cases as to whether or not you’re talking about a singular entity or a plural one, compared to figuring out whether or not “il” or “el” is gendered or ambiguous.  

I do think that English speakers should be more forgiving towards ESL speakers as I do honestly believe our language is a very difficult one to master and I have great respect for anyone that has bothered to learn it better than my own feeble attempts at foreign languages.

  ↳ **Jiggy90** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 5): People that say this often have a weird perception of language as if its something that doesn't change.

"You" used to be exclusively plural as well, in early modern English and before.  Language changed as "thee" and "thou" fell out of favor and a singular second person pronoun was needed to fill the old words' place.

Languages change.  What we teach in school is a general "best practice" but even then much of the language stuff will change with dialect and time.

As it is being peddled as a *meme*, that means that it is tapping a collective acknowledgement that this has happened multiple times and that others can relate, so it should be plural.

I would opt for the he version of the sentence, as it is clearer about person and quantity, and I have no qualms changing the gender of the pronoun if I later discover that it was different from the default selection.

But thou art not changing (nor am i) and quite honestly anyone still following along is not changing, just rooting for his team.  since I have better things to do, I will concede the final word to you below.  I won't be replying on this post after this.

1. rules for clear, precise communication, or
2. examples of incorrect usage that have been abused for so long that they are accepted as correct usage?

      ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 2): You said the word you, which used to be specifically plural but has become a more neutral use, if you want to follow your “rules for clear, precise communication”, please use “thee” or “thou” to make sure you are using singular pronouns, because otherwise it is “incorrect usage that has been abused for so long that it’s accepted as common usage.”

        ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 konamioctopus64646 (👍 1): English used to have formal and informal.  I still use both.  But you are not deserving of being addressed as thou.  And neither am I.

          ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 2): Once again you use the word “you”, which was originally designed to be plural. Why is it that “you” can be used as singular, but “they” can not. This may come as a shock to you, but languages change over time.

**MilledGears** (👍 1): I know in highschool English class we were thought that although using "they" is nicer when referring to someone of unspecified gender, using "it" is grammatically correct.

It is worth noting this was over a decade ago and language changes with time. When I was taught this gender was still considered interchangeable with sex and gender identity wasn't a prevalent topic.

I find it difficult to digest and maybe become defensive because I live my job, I get totally immersed in it, you know, with zeal. And seeing disbelief when somebody asks me what I'm doing at 8 pm and I say I'm working is a little unnerving.

But, well, what can you do. I still love it. I know there are teachers who are dumbasses, lazy gits or idiots. And I'm trying to do my job best I can.

**agent_raconteur** (👍 13): This is why the weird, recent backlash against the singular 'they' is silly. "Bought it with their own money" is perfectly fine

  ↳ **K-leb25** 回复 agent_raconteur (👍 1): Well I do wish there was a distinct word, because I hate the idea of using the same word to refer to a group of people and one person without gender specified. It seems like a real flaw in the English language, but it works for now and it is more personable than "it".

    ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 [deleted] (👍 4): people are revolting against using “they” as a single pronoun to refer to one person. they think that it’s impractical, but everyone uses it in their daily language anyway lol

      ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): Yeah I saw Oxford or somebody added the singular they to the dictionary last year and was [like](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/710/dd0.png), haven't we been doing that the whole time?

        ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): we have been! but a lot of transphobic people were like “wahhh it’s not in the dictionary that means it doesn’t exist” so oxford added it in iirc

          ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): SOO many older people I know are hung up on thinking that language is derived from the dictionary instead of the other way around. Probably what they were taught in school 50 years ago so a hard mental construct to break. 

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

            ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): the definition of -phobia is a fear *or aversion* and yet it’s so ignored lol

              ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

**holdingmytongue** (👍 3): This also is why I’ll never be comfortable calling someone ‘it’, even if it is their chosen pronoun.  Gender neutral terminology aside-‘it’ sounds so inhuman and derogatory. 
I will do whatever mental gymnastics is required to avoid calling you that.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Actually, "his/her" is gramatically correct, as weird as it may sound. Their suggests a plural possesive, and op is refering to a singular person

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): No, English has used "their" as a gender neutral singular forever. The idea that it this isn't proper English is a lot like the "split infinitives" rule or "never end with a preposition" rule. In that you hear people claim it is a rule but it's not actually a rule of standard English.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Then why did i learn it in english class my nib

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Because there are a lot of “traditionalists” who learned those so-called rules and then also teach them. And there are also a certain group of language prescriptivists who think they ought to be considered formal rules.

"Do not use "their" as an alternative to his or her; "their" should be used only when referring to a plural subject. Each of the rules here offers a method of avoiding gender-based language."

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

I actually feel bad for the kids because they don’t get much play and if they get any of their paperwork wrong parents come to me asking why. And if you have a bachelors in early childhood education You get the same amount of education as elementary teachers do. I am overqualified for my position. And the thing that makes me laugh the most is a lot of preschool teacher positions in the Phoenix area require a bachelors degrees yet they only want to pay $13 an hour

  ↳ **If_you_ban_me_I_win** 回复 cityofbrotherlyhate (👍 2): We don’t go to school to learn how to do our job. We go to school to learn how to learn to do our job. You’re basically asserting that a teacher should make more than me because they needed more initial schooling when in fact I had to spend much more time learning through apprenticeship then they did in class.

They don’t usually go to school to learn the material they teach unless they’re teaching at a college level. They go to school to learn how to manage children in groups.

Me on the other hand, I am qualified to teach my trade at the college level and I have held positions as a trainer for apprenticeships at more than one company.

And you do realize that cops are paid hourly right? The amount of work is the amount they’re paid. And it’s not much. Assuming you work 40 hours a week and are paid 28 which I believe is entry level. That’s about 53,000 a teacher is paid 60,000 however, a teacher teaches. A police officer has deal with criminals and basically every part of the job isn’t safe. So in terms of a job they should be paid more.

How does it do this? And how is this worse than the top 10% taking advantage of the lower 90%? Or using child and slave labour?

>or those who don’t value another human life as much as their own

Which is already a problem in capitalism. Capitalism is in the most literal sense, the high class using the lower class. Not valuing them as human lifes.


So my question is. How does socialism take advantage of the elite?

Okay, so where is your explanation?
And why resort to slurs? I'm simply asking you

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I report to ~~slurs~~ mean words because you clearly cant read or comprehend what you’re reading, so why argue? The only way to lose an argument with a moron is to keep arguing. So instead of arguing, I’m going to make fun of you

                  ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): But you never argued? You made a claim, with no explanation or backup claims.

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Remember when I said you couldn’t real at a level equivalent to a 2nd grader? This is what I meant lmfao

              ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Yes I can. I actually got pretty good grades. But you really need to learn how to have a discussion.

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I’m not trying to have a discussion with a fucking moron. I don’t see why you don’t know that after I told you repeatedly. Now, if you want to stop being a fucking moron and go away it be appreciated, because clearly you can’t comprehend what you read. 😘

                  ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I can easily comprehend what I read. You where the one saying socialism is bad, on my comment, so clearly you were coming in to this, to have a discussion or an argument. I wrote my comment because I wanted to make fun of the far right, and you ate the bait, but then continued to not saying anything of substance, except that "in socialism, the elite is oppressed". Why comment if you don't want to  argue your case

                    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I never said the elite is oppressed you fucking moron for the love of God learn how to comprehend what you read lmfao. You came to make fun of others but ended up playing yourself. Great job lmao

                      ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Okay then. Then "take advantage of" them. And you still haven't explained why, and I just wanna know why you think that would/do happen in socialism?

                        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I cant explain something I haven’t said, cant I?

Key word there, though. Most European countries certainly do have a lack of funding in education.

US has the 7th highest teacher salary, above the a majority of Europe.

**Chickennugget665** (👍 2): A lot of salty americans can't fathom that their country is quite shit at education compared to most of western Europe

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Chickennugget665 (👍 3): Except tens of thousands of europeans flock to american colleges every year, that american universities are definitevely the most prestigious and influential in the world and we produce the most tech innovations and grads.

    ↳ **BlingGeorge** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): That and an education in English is often seen as more valuable because English is spoken globally. That’s also why universities in the UK, Canada and Australia are full of foreigners

    ↳ **god_avocado** 回复 Impedus11 (👍 95): This is what I love about reddit. Its the best place to tell stories anonymously and everyone here thinks the same and accepts you. If you got a story to tell, tell it on reddit.

      ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 god_avocado (👍 76): I once jumped and hit my head on a ceiling fan (big sharp metal fucker) going *fast* 

Had a bone from my skull removed and spent 2 months in a hospital and spent like a year without any bone in my skull on the left side of my forehead

        ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 61): I am so fucking sorry about what happened to you but the randomness of the story and the way you told it gave me the hardest laugh in months

          ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 71Atlas (👍 38): Sounds horrendous, but it’s just so bizarre that I mainly use it as a cool/funny story to tell, and laugh while telling it xD

            ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 6): That's the coolest way of dealing with that kind of metal fan PTSD. I'm also a little relieved, I was feeling a little bad for laughing since that bastard fucked your head pretty badly

              ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 71Atlas (👍 8): I mean it was a pretty even fight, the fam blade was bent after that (I’ve often been told I have a very thicc skull, and that probably saved my life

                ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 7): At least the fan learned his lesson then. Your dry humor is dope, I'm sure that thicc head is there to protect an even thiccer brain

                  ↳ **god_avocado** 回复 71Atlas (👍 5): That boi is thicc

                ↳ **Freelance_Sockpuppet** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 3): You’d have to have a pretty thick skull to pick a fight with a fan /s

But really, did you not realise the fan was there was was the goal to jump to it?

I caught a wooden bat to the dome that split the skin really good and the doctor said I must have a thick skull to have not come out with major concussion

      ↳ **BanthaMilk** 回复 god_avocado (👍 2): the reason everyone on reddit thinks the same is because no one is allowed to have their own opinion, thanks to the almighty downvote. we've literally had to create a subreddit called unpopular opinion just so people can share their general personal thoughts and ideas without being downvoted to oblivion and losing all their karma to a comment which includes an opinion that is not generally accepted by people. reddit literally has almost no freedom of speech because of this platform's nature to get into arguments about the smallest things e.g. I was in a discussion and I mentioned something about how Ancient Rome had freedom of religion and this guy replied to me saying "wHaT aBoUt ThE pErSeCuTiOn Of ChRiStIaNs?!?!?".

      ↳ **chabbleor** 回复 god_avocado (👍 1): I love sea food, with the exception of shrimp. I thought, "shrimp is the most basic sea food there is, so if I love sea food, I must love shrimp." So every time I go out with friends or whoever and get dinner, if shrimp is on the menu in some dish, I order it. But every time so far, I have not enjoyed it at all and ended up regretting ordering the shrimp soup or whatever. My friends now question my love of sea food.

  ↳ **Nannobot12** 回复 revcio (👍 1): My bio teacher was a young guy like 25-30 and since he was young none of the classes would interact with him as our teacher but rather our friend it reached the point where he became the leader to every thing the school does like any events was led by him and really he was a fine man bo one was afraid of asking him anything and we loved him for it.

**Def_Not_Alt_Acct** (👍 42): I had this one teacher in middle school who was an 80 year old irish lad. In a section about how the US won the Revolutionary War he explained that the US troops were farmers and hunted more frequently and to show this he had one group train for ten minutes by throwing paper balls at targets while the other just sat there and then had us line up and throw paper at each other

  ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 Def_Not_Alt_Acct (👍 9): Sounds fun

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Def_Not_Alt_Acct (👍 8): [deleted]

    ↳ **sigmaluckynine** 回复 [deleted] (👍 8): Yeah but that was the first instance of industrialized warfare where training started to lose out in effectiveness

**Mysterious_Lesions** (👍 54): I cringe at how callous we were in high school with some of our teacher nicknames. I sometimes wish I could go back and slap teenage me. Don't get me wrong, I was pretty polite in most ways, but I definitely yielded a lot more to peer pressure on how to view teachers than I should have.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): But don't raise their salaries. They are just teaching the future \s

**[deleted]** (👍 -20): Wait... I thought God's work was being a fictional being used as an excuse for mass killings.....

**YourTypicalBoss** (👍 61): Honestly there’s certain things I want to get off my chest to certain teachers too. I never did anything like throwing a ball into a teacher’s face, but as a class we badgered the fuck out of a lot of teachers, particularly a really old Christian brother who (ironically) taught science. Because of his age we messed with him a lot (some really funny shit ngl but nonetheless cruel), but I know at least 3 guys who majored in a science field in college because of him.

  ↳ **Mysterious_Lesions** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 22): In our school, there was a tonne of badgering of the bus driver as well. It would be totally unacceptable to do this for a public transit driver.

School kids on this topic: You can be better than me.

  ↳ **SmokkeyDaPlug** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 3): Oh man how I feel this. Not all teachers I fucked aroubd with deserved it but there were some that all year it was war and I dont regret that shit.

    ↳ **tumeskin** 回复 SmokkeyDaPlug (👍 2): I'm 13 and if a teacher is strict thats ok, but I have one teacher who is an petty bish and multiple times shes given me an write-up thing for "not even trying to do my homework" although i've genuinely tryed my best so at first I was getting depressed over it, but since then I've started to not care about her and if she says something really stupid to me i'm sure as hell gonna talk back. But luckily all my other teachers are pretty nice and understanding.

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 tumeskin (👍 3): She is trying to convince you that you can do better. This is exactly the future regret you could be learning from in this thread lol

      ↳ **SmokkeyDaPlug** 回复 tumeskin (👍 -2): They got it out for you you just gotta show them exactly that.  That you dont care and if they wanna keep playing that its gonna be a loooong year for them. Lol

  ↳ **Crashbrennan** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 3): It's easy to forget that for hundreds of years, most science was done by Christian monks and Islamic scholars. Religion and science aren't as wholely incompatible as people think.

    ↳ **YourTypicalBoss** 回复 Crashbrennan (👍 3): True completely forgot about that

  ↳ **gibbee530** 回复 YourTypicalBoss (👍 1): Surely you are not suggesting that because was a Christian that he shouldn't be teaching Science? HAHA just busting your chops😝😝😝😝

**mronion82** (👍 17): There might be a Facebook group for the school- mine was tiny, about 600 pupils, but it's got a busy FB page with people who left decades ago. There's also likely to be a few people who never mentally left school and I bet they can name they guy you're talking about very quickly.

**[deleted]** (👍 23): My 5th grade teacher just died last year (over 20 years after 5th grade). He was such a legend that there were probably 75 former students in their 20s and 30s that he taught when they were 11. I hope I can make an impact like that one day.

  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I'm gonna guess he taught way more than 75 kids in that time

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Well yeah, but I'm pretty sure most teachers have zero former students at their funerals.

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Oh, you left that part out. That make more sense now.

**[deleted]** (👍 4): You could call the school and ask them for the teachers name I bet

  ↳ **Clumsy_Chica** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Last time I tried they said they couldn't give me information on past teachers unless I knew their name and was calling for a reference... That was a few years ago, I'll try again.

**BongRipsMcGee420** (👍 3): Call your school and ask

**gritbiddy90** (👍 1): Maybe u find out more info about him through your former classmates?

**laughingashley** (👍 1): Was the tattoo on his ass?

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): No, its on his back and its giant, takes up his whole back

    ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Yeah, if a dude started to remove his shirt at me, I'd probably shut that down quick too

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Uhm, why do you have to assume it was like that? I don't appreciate you assuming such a thing about my father. Literally just a dude who thought someone's custom art for him was good enough to get it tattooed onto him. And why did you assume it was on his ass?

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Also her problem wasn't him being shirtless it was that he got it tattooed onto him

          ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That could be support creepy, she might've thought his sincere gesture was showing obsessive stalker tendencies, you don't know her life lol jeez, why yell at me for it?

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): I didn't tell at you

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Yell* Fucking Phone

        ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): The ass part was obviously a joke, and everything I said was gleaned from finding a rational explanation for your description of her reaction. Calm your chodes.

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Chode* I'm pretty calm. If what you said what a joke congrats, to me it came off as sorta condescending.

            ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Trying to see another person's perspective shouldn't seem like a condescending thing.

              ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): It doesn't diminish your perspective to examine others', I mean

**OverlordWaffles** (👍 2): Yeah, I've only done it once, and it was for a college teacher. 

The teachers I were disrespectful to were the ones that repeatedly did so to me. I heard recently of one that was a complete asshole 24/7 was then working at a gas station near where I worked and I really wanted to go in there and give him a hard time. I didn't end up going though

**Azureflamedemon** (👍 13): You definitely have a point!

**Jackal7112** (👍 2): It wasn't even a toxic relationship between me and them. We kind of just stopped talking. I don't think my parents were very fond of them, but that's about the only reason. When I was younger, the only time we ever really saw them was when someone was dying.

  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 Jackal7112 (👍 2): Oh, well then maybe you should reach out! I had a similar situation in my fam, but after I tried to reestablish communication, she didn't even bother responding so.... my advice is to try, but keep expectations low lol

    ↳ **Jackal7112** 回复 laughingashley (👍 2): I might just do that. Thank you kind internet stranger.

**K-leb25** (👍 2): You assume they no longer talk because of one side being nasty when more often it's just because people drift apart and change their social priorities.

      ↳ **PM_ME_DND_FIGURINES** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 2): I mean. I wouldn't say $100 is a small amount, but I wouldn't call it a lot either.

      ↳ **GhettoComic** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 5): Depends who you’re asking. Its not alot for me

        ↳ **BiggestStalin** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 18): We are talking about teachers here who are living on a trinket wage for the work they do, I don't get why you jumping in to flaunt that 100$ isn't much for YOU is relevant to the conversation.

          ↳ **GhettoComic** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 14): No you literally just said “in the west its alot especially for teachers” you implied its alot for everyone more so teachers. This isnt true, live in a big city and it really isnt much. Stop trying so hard to twist what I said.

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 7): IT'S A LOT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT EASILY, SHUTCHO ASS AND GO PLAY STARDEW VALLEY WITH YOUR 3090

            ↳ **TotallyNotInsaneTaco** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 1): No one’s twisting what you said but that’s a privileged mindset dawg, it’s good that you’re able to spend that no problem but for most people $100 isn’t exactly a small amount y’know?

            ↳ **RandomAmbles** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 1): It can save about 2 good years of a stranger's life. That's a lot of money, since it's worth that much coming from anyone.

Super nice teacher. Probably made a lot of kids feel better about their education in general. Mad respect.

          ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 4): They make like 90k a year my guy 💀

            ↳ **MammothImplement1066** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): The average teacher salary at a public school is 53k a year. And the range is usually from 44k to 65k not even close to 90k unless your thinking about a college proffesor or maybe private schools?

              ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 MammothImplement1066 (👍 2): I saw a document of my own school (high school) and the teachers made around 90-120k, some quite a bit more. I’m in Canada tho

                ↳ **MammothImplement1066** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): That might be why, i was using stats from the US

            ↳ **clover_1414** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): How much $ they make depends on where they teach.

            ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): what are you on bro. name one teacher making more than 75k a year i dare you.

              ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 seanrosenkranz (👍 1): How is bro finding this comment a year later 

To answer, my teachers all make 100+ a year, and I’m not American. (Not everyone is, shocking!)

                ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): damn bruh for a comment that you posted like a year ago you sure responded quick asf lmfao and i just saw it bc im not on reddit 24/7. this is like the first time ive been on reddit in a BRICK and that would make sense why they make so much more. bc they dont teach in america. teachers in america are hardly sniffing 50-60k yearly

                ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): oh and how much is 100k in your currency vs the USD

                  ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 seanrosenkranz (👍 1): 74k

    ↳ **Mehroli** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): tho tbf in south asia food is also way cheaper, same pizza you would pay 5$ in the us would be 1,50$ equivalent in some countries

    ↳ **solublekarma93** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): On a teachers salary that’s a whole heckin lot in America too

    ↳ **SLEDGEHAMMAA** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): In the west, it's still a lot, but not an incredible amount if it's only once a year. $100 is only like 2 or 3 days or working minimum wage

    ↳ **tacosbanos_inuranos** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Depends on which South East Asian country youre in. If you are in Singapore that money is not a lot

      ↳ **Lil_Phantoms_Lawyer** 回复 Ninja__Shuriken (👍 1): Yep. Same.

    ↳ **Fancy_Cat3571** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): For a teacher that’s about half a day’s pay

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Unless you’re like a millionaire or something I think $100 is a universally-recognized lot of money

    ↳ **xbwtyzbchs** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): >  in the west it isn't but here in South Asia..... It's a lot of Fucking money

and pizza in South Asia is a SHIT TON more expensive than it is here in the US.

**MayoneggVeal** (👍 5): I always want to do cool things for my class, and then I multiply the cost by 35 to 38 kids and my wallet says no.

**Jakslayer** (👍 2): I had a class with 3 other students before

**K-leb25** (👍 1): Man that should be illegal.

**WubbaLubbaDubStep** (👍 3): So, $175?  That’s expensive, but not exactly bank-breaking if you do it once a year.  Definitely worth the investment if it helps make all your kids behave.

  ↳ **msndrstdmstrmnd** 回复 WubbaLubbaDubStep (👍 7): Have you even seen teachers salaries? And in addition a lot of teachers pay for a ton of their classroom’s supplies out of pocket because of such low funding for schools. A lot of teachers work two or three jobs because their teaching salary alone can’t sustain them

    ↳ **Scam_unlikely11111** 回复 msndrstdmstrmnd (👍 1): My history teacher has ten year and has out dated books and charges 400 for them to be replaced he has a Camaro and a mini fridge he doesn't pay for none of his school stuff and when he did was a long ass time ago

  ↳ **59265358979323846264** 回复 WubbaLubbaDubStep (👍 3): Ah yeah I'll do it for all 5 of my classes. Casually spend almost $1000. Or about 2.5% of my pretax salary

    ↳ **WubbaLubbaDubStep** 回复 59265358979323846264 (👍 0): Good point, I forget teachers have multiple classes, although I think OP alluded that they were maybe their only class.  If not, maybe her wife/husband does well?  I know if my wife was a teacher, I’d let her be extra liberal with spending on her kids.

**R4V3-0N** (👍 3): Never have I seen a "Fuck you" that I agreed with more than this.  


Even more so happy to see them being suspended.

**cavemaneca** (👍 48): While I agree with you in concept, it would honestly be more like $150-$200 to buy pizza for one whole class based on the average class size in the US. That's still an awful lot for a teacher to just spend out of pocket when they're paid shit and have to bring their own personal supplies into school.

  ↳ **czs5056** 回复 cavemaneca (👍 23): Obviously pizza won't cost $1000, but I wanted to throw a figure out there that would allow a person to buy 30 some odd pizzas at a time and not think twice about it.

**grunt_amu2629** (👍 -53): You can get like 30 Jack's pizzas for $90. LMFAO.  Y'all are salty, broke as fuck, and have no idea how to bargain hunt.. probably why you are struggling.  $1000 for pizza's??  Where the fuck you shoppin' my man.

  ↳ **The_Asia-Boy** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 17): He didn't meant only for pizza. He meant it in general. Are you not qbke do realise that there are people who need every cent they earn???

  ↳ **czs5056** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 8): It's not 1k for pizza, it's 1k of money that can be spent on anything after paying bills. Since this is being done at the school we need to assume that it's hot pizza being delivered not frozen unless the school is going to allow the teacher to use an oven in the kitchen

  ↳ **milkshake398** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 2): Who the fuck is jack not everybody has the same pizza place

  ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 2): When you're dumb but don't realize it you end up making comments like this guy's. Over here taking an obviously hyperbolic comment literally and not realizing how stupid it makes him look. 

Damn, too bad you didn't have a teacher to reward your dumbass in school, might have made you learn more.

    ↳ **grunt_amu2629** 回复 ImKindaBoring (👍 0): Idk bro, you look pretty dumb too you fucking moron.

      ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 grunt_amu2629 (👍 1): Wow, eloquent rebuttal!

**Hazardish08** (👍 2): Also the fact that a lot of teachers have families meaning some 50-60k a year doesn’t seem that much and they will run low on cash a few times.

**LethalSalad** (👍 1): Still, around 30 cheap pizzas would be like 60 bucks, that's pretty doable for a once-a-year thing or something. She sounds like one of those good teachers who genuinely enjoy their students' happiness, so that would be pretty worth it.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 2): I don't think you couldn't find 30 pizzas for 60 bucks for a school party. Even at the grocery store, if you could get 30 of their cheapest pizzas it would most likely still be more than $60. I don't recall ever seeing a full pizza for less than 2 bucks. This school would also have to have a bunch of large ovens that are available for use (which they very well could). 

Getting them delivered is really the only reasonable way to have 30 pizzas all ready to eat at the same time.

Edit: just my thoughts, I'm no pizza party planning expert

  ↳ **ImKindaBoring** 回复 LethalSalad (👍 0): Where you finding $2 pizzas? Would probably be more like $150 which can be a sizable amount for someone living paycheck to paycheck as many teachers do. But, again, the key takeaway is the comment was hyperbolic, it isn't meant to be taken literally.

**grunt_amu2629** (👍 -2): Hey it's all about the small victories my man.

    ↳ **PayMeInSteak** 回复 jcutta (👍 1): I do have a vape. It's the only thing that actually helps me with the quit portion of the cycle. 

I have a lot of friends that smoke too so that's the REALLY hard part. They have no plans on quitting. Lol

      ↳ **jcutta** 回复 PayMeInSteak (👍 1): I've been mostly off cigs for almost a decade (I still smoke when I go to like all inclusives lol) but being around smokers still gets me hardcore wanting to light up.

Try using nic salts if you haven't. Any tobacco tastes like shit to me now when I use them.

**The_Daddelbox** (👍 17): ok let me rephrase aswell:  
In germany teachers arent underpaid to a point where they even struggle to survive on 2 jobs.

  ↳ **Samsuxx** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 6): Lol do American teachers?

Sorry, I didn't mean to go all ACKSHUALLY on you, I was just venting some frustration having worked with teachers in Germany.

  ↳ **HazelnitBoyyy** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): A good part of America pays their teachers atleast decently. Where Im from, the teachers start at around 60k and make around 100k a year by the end. Plus, teachers get more time off than most jobs (not justifying them getting paid too little, im just saying it isnt as bad as it seems)

    ↳ **Aggravating-Abroad44** 回复 HazelnitBoyyy (👍 1): There’s more jobs that don’t pay than do. My wife’s been a teacher at 4 locations in Ohio and still makes half of what her pay should be. She has 10 years of experience. The problem with teaching is that you rarely get hired for experience but because your family. I’ve seen people sub for a decade and still not get hired when a spot opens.

**gojirra** (👍 2): I get your point,  that all teachers everywhere deserve more. Honestly yes, bless them, but some societies actually do value teachers and pay them fair wages.

**The_Daddelbox** (👍 5): 5,50?
Petrol's 2,17-1,50€ per litre

  ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 The_Daddelbox (👍 3): I'm comparing to America since thats what the underpaid teacher salary is about.    And. I'm comparing here gallons vs germany in gallons.   There's about 3.7 liters in a gallon and every euro is about 1.18 USD   If then compared to here that teacher in germany is essentially paying 6.49 USD to 9.47 USD per gallon of gas.   Or gas is around 1.89 in most places with California being one of the highest by far at 3.27.

I'm just saying its still seems like tewchee get underpaid in general when compared to cost of living in a lot of places.

**gojirra** (👍 5): Ok oil subsidy lobbyist. Imagine trying to guess the cost of living based on gas and electricity alone lol.

  ↳ **Yog-S0th0th** 回复 gojirra (👍 1): Imagine not taking that into account at all.  LOL

**KingBellmann** (👍 2): But 1. You don't need to drive as far as in the USA and 2. Stuff like rent is cheaper over here, as long as you don't live in the top 5 cities.

  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 KingBellmann (👍 1): "You don't need to drive as far in the US?" Pff, ok. People here drive over an hour to get to work, as a general minimum, so I don't know your frame of reference here. I've always had to leave at LEAST an hour before my shift in all of the places I've lived or worked. My mom does the same. The United States are vastly spread out, with most states being filled with farm lands and ranches, meaning "town" is further away from homes. Even in cities, though, it takes forever to get anywhere because of congestion and traffic and construction. I can't think of any experience where I didn't work pretty far from where I lived unless I was in high school. Even when I worked in LA, a ton of my coworkers drove to their jobs from Palmdale or Lancaster, even Santa Clarita isn't very close.

How the f far are you driving in Germany to reach this conclusion, and why would anyone drive further than that?? I'm totally amazed if it's further!

    ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 laughingashley (👍 5): I said that germans do NOT drive as far and much as Americans, therefore we don't need as much fuel and higher fuel prices hurt less...

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 KingBellmann (👍 1): Ah, my mistake. I was truly astounded lol

**SpiderFlame04** (👍 5): That’s better than my middle school in Kansas. Most of the teachers were giving kids an extra credit point to buy a box of Kleenex for them because there wasn’t any class funds budget.

  ↳ **akatherder** 回复 SpiderFlame04 (👍 2): It's standard in our kids' elementary school that every kid brings in some ziploc bags, tissue, hand sanitizer, etc. during the first week.  It's part of the "School supplies list."  Then the teacher makes it available to everyone throughout the year.  We're a upper-middle class suburb.

    ↳ **SpiderFlame04** 回复 akatherder (👍 2): I get that, but you’d think they’d give free tissues to an eighth grade class

**AsymmetricPanda** (👍 2): Yes, if it’s just leftover budget that was assigned to teachers for class supplies. Some of teacher salary comes from taxes and they probably spend some of it on pizza anyway

  ↳ **ComplainyGuy** 回复 [deleted] (👍 75): If my dog can avoid shitting in the house, and won't steal my food off my plate (she's a good dog), a sane functional human animal should be able to not mash good feeling parts where they aren't supposed to.

Being hormonal isn't an excuse for boys to fight or rape. Being hormonal isn't an excuse for girls to cheat or be irrational.

    ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 ComplainyGuy (👍 17): I agree but those are learned behaviours. Sometimes instincts win over education. 

Still doesn't justify it though, just trying to explain it.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LiarsFearTruth (👍 11): [deleted]

        ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 17): Because the overwhelming majority of people are anti science and anti-intellectualism. 

Just bring up how faith is a form of superstition and you'll get bullied and mocked, by the same people who say are anti-bullying. 

People only like "wholesome" and "positive" science. 

Anything too real and the cognitive dissonance beats out their reason. These are all well known and recorded psychological interactions

  ↳ **It_Calls_to_You** 回复 [deleted] (👍 6): But we aren't wild animals?.. It seems like you're just trying to make a "profound" statement.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 It_Calls_to_You (👍 13): The guy he’s replying to said he didn’t understand why people cheat, the other guy was trying to express the dichotomy of our animalistic nature vs our self-awareness and intelligence relative to other creatures, this awareness can make animalistic things like cheating, fighting, murder, rape etc. seem unexplainable and horrible when they’re common in nature. I don’t think he was trying to be /r/iamverysmart he was just trying to comment on the guy who said he didn’t understand why people cheat

      ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Exactly. You nailed it. 


Even horrible "crimes" (we decided they are crimes) like murder and cannibalism and rape are just normal survival evolutionary behaviors in nature. 

We created society and its rules but our instincts are still there, waiting under the outer shell of civility.

    ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 It_Calls_to_You (👍 6): I'm saying the distinction between wild and not wild is arbitrary and made up by humans to distinguish ourselves from all other life. 


Scientifically speaking,  we are all just animals. There is no distinction.


Which explains the behaviour of our most savage members.

    ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -6): Trust me, if you tell someone you are leaving because you want to date someone else, they will react just as badly, if not worse, than if you are caught cheating.

      ↳ **ZombieDonShula** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 15): So if they're both the same than do the more ethical one?

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 12): Then adhere to your ethics. Minimization of harm would be to break up with your partner vs. cheating on them. Idiot.

            ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): No, it would be to keep them from finding out, that way they aren't made unhappy.

**Suekru** (👍 3): Then leave your partner. The only time “cheating”
Is acceptable is perhaps the cheater is in an abusive relationship and can’t leave at the moment.

But even then I’d advise against it for their safety if their SO is abusive.

**K-leb25** (👍 1): That's why I think people should only marry if they've been together for _several_ years and are _100%_ sure they've met their soul mate and BFF.

I reckon the cultural perception should shift from being so focused on having a partner for life (especially in countries with less and less people having kids) and instead be more communal, if that makes sense. Don't focus on loving one person but understand you may love multiple.

**CookieIsAMobster** (👍 39): Where are you from? Where I'm from in the US the lowest possible A was 93.

  ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 CookieIsAMobster (👍 30): Canada. 80-84 = A- / 85-89 = A / 90+ = A+

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 9): Ye then that A- is more equivalent to a B+ or a B in systems where there's no A+.

Not a bad grade by any means, just looks better than it is when you're used to A- being really close to perfect.

      ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 7): Not necessarily though, because while the US system is designed in such a way that getting an A is possible through hard work, other countries have systems where getting the equivalent is simply not really a realistic goal. The tests are designed so that effectively everyone makes mistakes, getting even 90 percent right can mean that you are good at the subject, smart in general, and working very hard - anything less and lower grades are usual. I don't know if it's the case in Canada as well, but I think it's possible that that is why they changed the numbers for the letter grades.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 8): At LSE in London I remember something like a 60% was an A lol. The tests were much harder though..

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

              ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 2): Really? Where I live getting 90-93 is considered an A- and 80-84 would be a D+ (assuming A+ to D- scale). Our 75 is an F ):

      ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's rough. F here is anything under 50. With 50s being Ds, 60s Cs, 70s Bs, and 80+ As.

    ↳ **ScumlordAzazel** 回复 xLaZi3x (👍 1): The grading scale at my university was different depending on the subject. Most were 10 or but basic engineering courses were 93 and up as an A and the really hard 0hysics classes had like 85 and up as an A.

I also know Canada secondary schools have different grading scales depending on the province. Can't remember what it was for post-secondary schools because I was only calculating US equivalent GPAs at my last job for secondary schools. India has grading scales where you pass so long as it's above a 34. 34 to 44 would be a D.

Also, most US high schools use the 10 pt scale.

It's so cute watching you brag while you only speak 2.... Because I speak 4 languages, motherfucker. If you want to count my shitty Norwegian, I speak 5. I'm telling you this because by your logic I can declare you are also an idiot just because you know less than me.

Get over it. No one is an idiot because they're a beginner. If anything, being a beginner should be celebrated, because you're willing to learn something new.

> I don't see what's wrong calling a spade a spade.

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

**Aliensinnoh** (👍 3): Part of it is presumably schools funded at the state level would be funded through income taxes rather than property taxes. So suddenly all the towns spending half their budget on schools will be able to slash their property taxes while the state raises income taxes on everyone.

  ↳ **jcutta** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 2): Someone could hand NJ enough money to fund schools for the rest of time and they still would raise property taxes every year.

  ↳ **TragedyPornFamilyVid** 回复 Aliensinnoh (👍 1): Texas doesn't have an income tax.

Everything is funded through property tax or sales tax. As a result, they passed the "Robinhood act" to redistribute funds to poorer school districts.

For example,  between 2014 and 2018 Austin ISD increased taxes collected for education from about $700 million to almost $1200 million, but the budget for their school district remained stagnant.

The local residents could vote to double their taxes again, but they wouldn't be able to give their local schools any additional funds.  Those would be recaptured by the state. More than half of Austin ISD's students are "economically disadvantaged" and about quarter need ESL classes, but the land is valuable, so the district has to give money away to district with lower property values.

It's made them the icon of people who oppose that law, but the truth is that the state is obligated to provide an education to everyone.  If people don't want an income tax, this is the alternative.

**Pete_Booty_Judge** (👍 1): Take this with a huge grain of salt that I know only a very entry level bit of Spanish and French, but my experience with those languages at least is that their singular, possessive references really aren’t that ambiguous as they are still gendered.  

I’m more than ok with American English (I can’t speak to what other English speaking countries are doing) using plural pronouns to maintain ambiguity, as I think the context is even easier to spot in many cases as to whether or not you’re talking about a singular entity or a plural one, compared to figuring out whether or not “il” or “el” is gendered or ambiguous.  

I do think that English speakers should be more forgiving towards ESL speakers as I do honestly believe our language is a very difficult one to master and I have great respect for anyone that has bothered to learn it better than my own feeble attempts at foreign languages.

**Jiggy90** (👍 5): People that say this often have a weird perception of language as if its something that doesn't change.

"You" used to be exclusively plural as well, in early modern English and before.  Language changed as "thee" and "thou" fell out of favor and a singular second person pronoun was needed to fill the old words' place.

Languages change.  What we teach in school is a general "best practice" but even then much of the language stuff will change with dialect and time.

**[deleted]** (👍 16): We're probably too sensitive, I guess. And you're right that teachers tend to tell people how hard they work. Idk, in the jobs that I did before becoming a teacher, no one told me to my face that my job is idk too easy, or my profession is for lazy people. I've been told numerous times that teachers earn too much for the job they do. I find it difficult to digest and maybe become defensive because I live my job, I get totally immersed in it, you know, with zeal. And seeing disbelief when somebody asks me what I'm doing at 8 pm and I say I'm working is a little unnerving.

But, well, what can you do. I still love it. I know there are teachers who are dumbasses, lazy gits or idiots. And I'm trying to do my job best I can.

      ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): we have been! but a lot of transphobic people were like “wahhh it’s not in the dictionary that means it doesn’t exist” so oxford added it in iirc

        ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): SOO many older people I know are hung up on thinking that language is derived from the dictionary instead of the other way around. Probably what they were taught in school 50 years ago so a hard mental construct to break. 

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

          ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): the definition of -phobia is a fear *or aversion* and yet it’s so ignored lol

            ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

**[deleted]** (👍 3): No, English has used "their" as a gender neutral singular forever. The idea that it this isn't proper English is a lot like the "split infinitives" rule or "never end with a preposition" rule. In that you hear people claim it is a rule but it's not actually a rule of standard English.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Then why did i learn it in english class my nib

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Because there are a lot of “traditionalists” who learned those so-called rules and then also teach them. And there are also a certain group of language prescriptivists who think they ought to be considered formal rules.

"Do not use "their" as an alternative to his or her; "their" should be used only when referring to a plural subject. Each of the rules here offers a method of avoiding gender-based language."

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

You’re basically asserting that a teacher should make more than me because they needed more initial schooling when in fact I had to spend much more time learning through apprenticeship then they did in class.

They don’t usually go to school to learn the material they teach unless they’re teaching at a college level. They go to school to learn how to manage children in groups.

Me on the other hand, I am qualified to teach my trade at the college level and I have held positions as a trainer for apprenticeships at more than one company.

How does it do this? And how is this worse than the top 10% taking advantage of the lower 90%? Or using child and slave labour?

>or those who don’t value another human life as much as their own

Which is already a problem in capitalism. Capitalism is in the most literal sense, the high class using the lower class. Not valuing them as human lifes.


So my question is. How does socialism take advantage of the elite?

And why resort to slurs? I'm simply asking you

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I report to ~~slurs~~ mean words because you clearly cant read or comprehend what you’re reading, so why argue? The only way to lose an argument with a moron is to keep arguing. So instead of arguing, I’m going to make fun of you

                ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): But you never argued? You made a claim, with no explanation or backup claims.

                ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I can easily comprehend what I read. You where the one saying socialism is bad, on my comment, so clearly you were coming in to this, to have a discussion or an argument. I wrote my comment because I wanted to make fun of the far right, and you ate the bait, but then continued to not saying anything of substance, except that "in socialism, the elite is oppressed". Why comment if you don't want to  argue your case

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I never said the elite is oppressed you fucking moron for the love of God learn how to comprehend what you read lmfao. You came to make fun of others but ended up playing yourself. Great job lmao

                    ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Okay then. Then "take advantage of" them. And you still haven't explained why, and I just wanna know why you think that would/do happen in socialism?

So every time I go out with friends or whoever and get dinner, if shrimp is on the menu in some dish, I order it. But every time so far, I have not enjoyed it at all and ended up regretting ordering the shrimp soup or whatever. My friends now question my love of sea food.

**czs5056** (👍 8): It's not 1k for pizza, it's 1k of money that can be spent on anything after paying bills. Since this is being done at the school we need to assume that it's hot pizza being delivered not frozen unless the school is going to allow the teacher to use an oven in the kitchen

**[deleted]** (👍 2): I don't think you couldn't find 30 pizzas for 60 bucks for a school party. Even at the grocery store, if you could get 30 of their cheapest pizzas it would most likely still be more than $60. I don't recall ever seeing a full pizza for less than 2 bucks. This school would also have to have a bunch of large ovens that are available for use (which they very well could). 

Getting them delivered is really the only reasonable way to have 30 pizzas all ready to eat at the same time.

Edit: just my thoughts, I'm no pizza party planning expert

**ImKindaBoring** (👍 0): Where you finding $2 pizzas? Would probably be more like $150 which can be a sizable amount for someone living paycheck to paycheck as many teachers do. But, again, the key takeaway is the comment was hyperbolic, it isn't meant to be taken literally.

**The_Fluffy_Walrus** (👍 1): It's been replaced with STAAR.

  ↳ **waitingtodiesoon** 回复 The_Fluffy_Walrus (👍 2): Do teachers still hate teaching the materials for it? I remember they hated taking time out of their course schedule to teaching us stuff specifically for it.

**jcutta** (👍 1): You tried vaping? It's the only thing that ever worked for me. It's so stupidly demonized now but it was a God send for me to get off tobacco.

  ↳ **PayMeInSteak** 回复 jcutta (👍 1): I do have a vape. It's the only thing that actually helps me with the quit portion of the cycle. 

I have a lot of friends that smoke too so that's the REALLY hard part. They have no plans on quitting. Lol

    ↳ **jcutta** 回复 PayMeInSteak (👍 1): I've been mostly off cigs for almost a decade (I still smoke when I go to like all inclusives lol) but being around smokers still gets me hardcore wanting to light up.

Try using nic salts if you haven't. Any tobacco tastes like shit to me now when I use them.

**Samsuxx** (👍 6): Lol do American teachers?

Sorry, I didn't mean to go all ACKSHUALLY on you, I was just venting some frustration having worked with teachers in Germany.

**HazelnitBoyyy** (👍 3): A good part of America pays their teachers atleast decently. Where Im from, the teachers start at around 60k and make around 100k a year by the end. Plus, teachers get more time off than most jobs (not justifying them getting paid too little, im just saying it isnt as bad as it seems)

  ↳ **Aggravating-Abroad44** 回复 HazelnitBoyyy (👍 1): There’s more jobs that don’t pay than do. My wife’s been a teacher at 4 locations in Ohio and still makes half of what her pay should be. She has 10 years of experience. The problem with teaching is that you rarely get hired for experience but because your family. I’ve seen people sub for a decade and still not get hired when a spot opens.

**Yog-S0th0th** (👍 3): I'm comparing to America since thats what the underpaid teacher salary is about.    And. I'm comparing here gallons vs germany in gallons.   There's about 3.7 liters in a gallon and every euro is about 1.18 USD   If then compared to here that teacher in germany is essentially paying 6.49 USD to 9.47 USD per gallon of gas.   Or gas is around 1.89 in most places with California being one of the highest by far at 3.27.

I'm just saying its still seems like tewchee get underpaid in general when compared to cost of living in a lot of places.

**Yog-S0th0th** (👍 1): Imagine not taking that into account at all.  LOL

**laughingashley** (👍 1): "You don't need to drive as far in the US?" Pff, ok. People here drive over an hour to get to work, as a general minimum, so I don't know your frame of reference here. I've always had to leave at LEAST an hour before my shift in all of the places I've lived or worked. My mom does the same. The United States are vastly spread out, with most states being filled with farm lands and ranches, meaning "town" is further away from homes. Even in cities, though, it takes forever to get anywhere because of congestion and traffic and construction. I can't think of any experience where I didn't work pretty far from where I lived unless I was in high school. Even when I worked in LA, a ton of my coworkers drove to their jobs from Palmdale or Lancaster, even Santa Clarita isn't very close.

How the f far are you driving in Germany to reach this conclusion, and why would anyone drive further than that?? I'm totally amazed if it's further!

  ↳ **KingBellmann** 回复 laughingashley (👍 5): I said that germans do NOT drive as far and much as Americans, therefore we don't need as much fuel and higher fuel prices hurt less...

    ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 KingBellmann (👍 1): Ah, my mistake. I was truly astounded lol

**akatherder** (👍 2): It's standard in our kids' elementary school that every kid brings in some ziploc bags, tissue, hand sanitizer, etc. during the first week.  It's part of the "School supplies list."  Then the teacher makes it available to everyone throughout the year.  We're a upper-middle class suburb.

  ↳ **SpiderFlame04** 回复 akatherder (👍 2): I get that, but you’d think they’d give free tissues to an eighth grade class

**ComplainyGuy** (👍 75): If my dog can avoid shitting in the house, and won't steal my food off my plate (she's a good dog), a sane functional human animal should be able to not mash good feeling parts where they aren't supposed to.

Being hormonal isn't an excuse for boys to fight or rape. Being hormonal isn't an excuse for girls to cheat or be irrational.

  ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 ComplainyGuy (👍 17): I agree but those are learned behaviours. Sometimes instincts win over education. 

Still doesn't justify it though, just trying to explain it.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LiarsFearTruth (👍 11): [deleted]

      ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 17): Because the overwhelming majority of people are anti science and anti-intellectualism. 

Just bring up how faith is a form of superstition and you'll get bullied and mocked, by the same people who say are anti-bullying. 

People only like "wholesome" and "positive" science. 

Anything too real and the cognitive dissonance beats out their reason. These are all well known and recorded psychological interactions

**It_Calls_to_You** (👍 6): But we aren't wild animals?.. It seems like you're just trying to make a "profound" statement.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 It_Calls_to_You (👍 13): The guy he’s replying to said he didn’t understand why people cheat, the other guy was trying to express the dichotomy of our animalistic nature vs our self-awareness and intelligence relative to other creatures, this awareness can make animalistic things like cheating, fighting, murder, rape etc. seem unexplainable and horrible when they’re common in nature. I don’t think he was trying to be /r/iamverysmart he was just trying to comment on the guy who said he didn’t understand why people cheat

    ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Exactly. You nailed it. 


Even horrible "crimes" (we decided they are crimes) like murder and cannibalism and rape are just normal survival evolutionary behaviors in nature. 

We created society and its rules but our instincts are still there, waiting under the outer shell of civility.

  ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 It_Calls_to_You (👍 6): I'm saying the distinction between wild and not wild is arbitrary and made up by humans to distinguish ourselves from all other life. 


Scientifically speaking,  we are all just animals. There is no distinction.


Which explains the behaviour of our most savage members.

    ↳ **ZombieDonShula** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 15): So if they're both the same than do the more ethical one?

      ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 ZombieDonShula (👍 -9): My ethics are based on minimization of harm.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 12): Then adhere to your ethics. Minimization of harm would be to break up with your partner vs. cheating on them. Idiot.

          ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): No, it would be to keep them from finding out, that way they aren't made unhappy.

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 7): Or, you could be honest so they could break up with your toxic ass and they can move on to someone who will treat them right.

**ZahariasX** (👍 30): Canada. 80-84 = A- / 85-89 = A / 90+ = A+

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 9): Ye then that A- is more equivalent to a B+ or a B in systems where there's no A+.

Not a bad grade by any means, just looks better than it is when you're used to A- being really close to perfect.

    ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 7): Not necessarily though, because while the US system is designed in such a way that getting an A is possible through hard work, other countries have systems where getting the equivalent is simply not really a realistic goal. The tests are designed so that effectively everyone makes mistakes, getting even 90 percent right can mean that you are good at the subject, smart in general, and working very hard - anything less and lower grades are usual. I don't know if it's the case in Canada as well, but I think it's possible that that is why they changed the numbers for the letter grades.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 8): At LSE in London I remember something like a 60% was an A lol. The tests were much harder though..

        ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): Yeah exactly! It sounds really strange to Americans usually, but I've lived in the US and in Europe and the tests in Europe are just way harder overal!

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

            ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 ZahariasX (👍 2): Really? Where I live getting 90-93 is considered an A- and 80-84 would be a D+ (assuming A+ to D- scale). Our 75 is an F ):

    ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's rough. F here is anything under 50. With 50s being Ds, 60s Cs, 70s Bs, and 80+ As.

**xLaZi3x** (👍 2): A good bit of Universities do a 10 point system especially technical or STEM schools. 

Never heard of an 80 being an A tho, would be a B(B-) most places I know of

Read the Canadian reply: That's interesting

  ↳ **ScumlordAzazel** 回复 xLaZi3x (👍 1): The grading scale at my university was different depending on the subject. Most were 10 or but basic engineering courses were 93 and up as an A and the really hard 0hysics classes had like 85 and up as an A.

I also know Canada secondary schools have different grading scales depending on the province. Can't remember what it was for post-secondary schools because I was only calculating US equivalent GPAs at my last job for secondary schools. India has grading scales where you pass so long as it's above a 34. 34 to 44 would be a D.

Also, most US high schools use the 10 pt scale.

**RainingDeathx** (👍 1): They changed the grade scale where i live (virginia) so that a 90 is an a and a b is an 80

He isn't doomed to lifelong idiocy; he can crawl out of the hole he's in, if he wishes to, but as of right now, he hasn't, and therefore, by definition, is an idiot. Sorry, but facts are facts.

Don't sell these as facts. They are not. They're your opinion, and nothing more.

> I do speak a second language

It's so cute watching you brag while you only speak 2.... Because I speak 4 languages, motherfucker. If you want to count my shitty Norwegian, I speak 5. I'm telling you this because by your logic I can declare you are also an idiot just because you know less than me.

Get over it. No one is an idiot because they're a beginner. If anything, being a beginner should be celebrated, because you're willing to learn something new.

> I don't see what's wrong calling a spade a spade.

Well, then you are a lost cause!

      ↳ **listenupsmartass** 回复 LastCommander086 (👍 1): Bragging? You presumed that I wasn't bilingual, and I simply refuted your shitty hypothesis. If anyone here's bragging, it would be you, but that's not the point. 

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

For example,  between 2014 and 2018 Austin ISD increased taxes collected for education from about $700 million to almost $1200 million, but the budget for their school district remained stagnant.

The local residents could vote to double their taxes again, but they wouldn't be able to give their local schools any additional funds.  Those would be recaptured by the state. More than half of Austin ISD's students are "economically disadvantaged" and about quarter need ESL classes, but the land is valuable, so the district has to give money away to district with lower property values.

It's made them the icon of people who oppose that law, but the truth is that the state is obligated to provide an education to everyone.  If people don't want an income tax, this is the alternative.

    ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): If this were a singular event referencing ONE teacher then the plural wouldn't make sense.  As it is being peddled as a *meme*, that means that it is tapping a collective acknowledgement that this has happened multiple times and that others can relate, so it should be plural.

I would opt for the he version of the sentence, as it is clearer about person and quantity, and I have no qualms changing the gender of the pronoun if I later discover that it was different from the default selection.

                    ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I still use thee and thou, but use is less common.  language does change, sometimes for the better, sometimes by brute force.  the debates matter.  as evidenced by the many words you have patiently dedicated to the topic, but they matter to me too.  the singular they was found its way in.  some have embraced it for political reasons.  and when dealing in certain specific cases, I can see its "value", but in general it is not needed and so we continue.  But thou art not changing (nor am i) and quite honestly anyone still following along is not changing, just rooting for his team.  since I have better things to do, I will concede the final word to you below.  I won't be replying on this post after this.

**rejeremiad** (👍 2): by grammar do you mean

1. rules for clear, precise communication, or
2. examples of incorrect usage that have been abused for so long that they are accepted as correct usage?

  ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 2): You said the word you, which used to be specifically plural but has become a more neutral use, if you want to follow your “rules for clear, precise communication”, please use “thee” or “thou” to make sure you are using singular pronouns, because otherwise it is “incorrect usage that has been abused for so long that it’s accepted as common usage.”

    ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 konamioctopus64646 (👍 1): English used to have formal and informal.  I still use both.  But you are not deserving of being addressed as thou.  And neither am I.

      ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 2): Once again you use the word “you”, which was originally designed to be plural. Why is it that “you” can be used as singular, but “they” can not. This may come as a shock to you, but languages change over time.

**rejeremiad** (👍 1): Has its place, but can be avoided and made more clear with just  a little forethought.

  ↳ **King-Of-Throwaways** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 7): Singular their has the added advantage of being inclusive to non-binary people.

      ↳ **King-Of-Throwaways** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 3): “They” applies to everyone by definition. Your feelings don’t factor into it.

        ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 King-Of-Throwaways (👍 2): he applies to everyone by thousands of years of precedent.  Your feelings don't factor into it.

          ↳ **King-Of-Throwaways** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 1): There’s obviously a major group not covered by “he”, but you already know this. Because for you, this isn’t about arguing sincerely; it’s about adopting any position that’s convenient until the opponent gets exhausted and gives up.

Try being sincere. It’s better for everyone, I promise.

            ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 King-Of-Throwaways (👍 2): I suppose anyone outside of mankind would be excluded, but I am not aware of any teachers who fall in this twisted venn diagram you have created.

    ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): we have been! but a lot of transphobic people were like “wahhh it’s not in the dictionary that means it doesn’t exist” so oxford added it in iirc

      ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): SOO many older people I know are hung up on thinking that language is derived from the dictionary instead of the other way around. Probably what they were taught in school 50 years ago so a hard mental construct to break. 

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

          ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

                  ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Okay then. Then "take advantage of" them. And you still haven't explained why, and I just wanna know why you think that would/do happen in socialism?

                                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Its not. But it sure helps you not be a moron. A core concept you seem adamant on denying yourself.

I don't spend much time on social media at all. I'm speaking from personal experience from real relationships. The political divide today is worse than it's been in a long time. That's not some underground conspiracy shit. It's easy to see if you talk to people.

US has the 7th highest teacher salary, above the a majority of Europe.

**BlingGeorge** (👍 2): That and an education in English is often seen as more valuable because English is spoken globally. That’s also why universities in the UK, Canada and Australia are full of foreigners

**god_avocado** (👍 95): This is what I love about reddit. Its the best place to tell stories anonymously and everyone here thinks the same and accepts you. If you got a story to tell, tell it on reddit.

  ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 god_avocado (👍 76): I once jumped and hit my head on a ceiling fan (big sharp metal fucker) going *fast* 

Had a bone from my skull removed and spent 2 months in a hospital and spent like a year without any bone in my skull on the left side of my forehead

    ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 61): I am so fucking sorry about what happened to you but the randomness of the story and the way you told it gave me the hardest laugh in months

      ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 71Atlas (👍 38): Sounds horrendous, but it’s just so bizarre that I mainly use it as a cool/funny story to tell, and laugh while telling it xD

        ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 6): That's the coolest way of dealing with that kind of metal fan PTSD. I'm also a little relieved, I was feeling a little bad for laughing since that bastard fucked your head pretty badly

          ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 71Atlas (👍 8): I mean it was a pretty even fight, the fam blade was bent after that (I’ve often been told I have a very thicc skull, and that probably saved my life

            ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 7): At least the fan learned his lesson then. Your dry humor is dope, I'm sure that thicc head is there to protect an even thiccer brain

              ↳ **god_avocado** 回复 71Atlas (👍 5): That boi is thicc

            ↳ **Freelance_Sockpuppet** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 3): You’d have to have a pretty thick skull to pick a fight with a fan /s

But really, did you not realise the fan was there was was the goal to jump to it?

I caught a wooden bat to the dome that split the skin really good and the doctor said I must have a thick skull to have not come out with major concussion

  ↳ **BanthaMilk** 回复 god_avocado (👍 2): the reason everyone on reddit thinks the same is because no one is allowed to have their own opinion, thanks to the almighty downvote. we've literally had to create a subreddit called unpopular opinion just so people can share their general personal thoughts and ideas without being downvoted to oblivion and losing all their karma to a comment which includes an opinion that is not generally accepted by people. reddit literally has almost no freedom of speech because of this platform's nature to get into arguments about the smallest things e.g. I was in a discussion and I mentioned something about how Ancient Rome had freedom of religion and this guy replied to me saying "wHaT aBoUt ThE pErSeCuTiOn Of ChRiStIaNs?!?!?".

  ↳ **chabbleor** 回复 god_avocado (👍 1): I love sea food, with the exception of shrimp. I thought, "shrimp is the most basic sea food there is, so if I love sea food, I must love shrimp." So every time I go out with friends or whoever and get dinner, if shrimp is on the menu in some dish, I order it. But every time so far, I have not enjoyed it at all and ended up regretting ordering the shrimp soup or whatever. My friends now question my love of sea food.

**tumeskin** (👍 2): I'm 13 and if a teacher is strict thats ok, but I have one teacher who is an petty bish and multiple times shes given me an write-up thing for "not even trying to do my homework" although i've genuinely tryed my best so at first I was getting depressed over it, but since then I've started to not care about her and if she says something really stupid to me i'm sure as hell gonna talk back. But luckily all my other teachers are pretty nice and understanding.

  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 tumeskin (👍 3): She is trying to convince you that you can do better. This is exactly the future regret you could be learning from in this thread lol

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Well yeah, but I'm pretty sure most teachers have zero former students at their funerals.

**laughingashley** (👍 2): Yeah, if a dude started to remove his shirt at me, I'd probably shut that down quick too

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Uhm, why do you have to assume it was like that? I don't appreciate you assuming such a thing about my father. Literally just a dude who thought someone's custom art for him was good enough to get it tattooed onto him. And why did you assume it was on his ass?

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Also her problem wasn't him being shirtless it was that he got it tattooed onto him

      ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That could be support creepy, she might've thought his sincere gesture was showing obsessive stalker tendencies, you don't know her life lol jeez, why yell at me for it?

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): I didn't tell at you

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Yell* Fucking Phone

    ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): The ass part was obviously a joke, and everything I said was gleaned from finding a rational explanation for your description of her reaction. Calm your chodes.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): Chode* I'm pretty calm. If what you said what a joke congrats, to me it came off as sorta condescending.

        ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Trying to see another person's perspective shouldn't seem like a condescending thing.

          ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): It doesn't diminish your perspective to examine others', I mean

**Jackal7112** (👍 2): I might just do that. Thank you kind internet stranger.

**BiggestStalin** (👍 204): In the West it's a lot, especially for a teacher. I think what he means is that the 100$ is worth the memory that it created.

  ↳ **PM_ME_DND_FIGURINES** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 2): I mean. I wouldn't say $100 is a small amount, but I wouldn't call it a lot either.

  ↳ **GhettoComic** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 5): Depends who you’re asking. Its not alot for me

    ↳ **BiggestStalin** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 18): We are talking about teachers here who are living on a trinket wage for the work they do, I don't get why you jumping in to flaunt that 100$ isn't much for YOU is relevant to the conversation.

      ↳ **GhettoComic** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 14): No you literally just said “in the west its alot especially for teachers” you implied its alot for everyone more so teachers. This isnt true, live in a big city and it really isnt much. Stop trying so hard to twist what I said.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 7): IT'S A LOT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT EASILY, SHUTCHO ASS AND GO PLAY STARDEW VALLEY WITH YOUR 3090

        ↳ **TotallyNotInsaneTaco** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 1): No one’s twisting what you said but that’s a privileged mindset dawg, it’s good that you’re able to spend that no problem but for most people $100 isn’t exactly a small amount y’know?

        ↳ **RandomAmbles** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 1): It can save about 2 good years of a stranger's life. That's a lot of money, since it's worth that much coming from anyone.

Super nice teacher. Probably made a lot of kids feel better about their education in general. Mad respect.

      ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 BiggestStalin (👍 4): They make like 90k a year my guy 💀

        ↳ **MammothImplement1066** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): The average teacher salary at a public school is 53k a year. And the range is usually from 44k to 65k not even close to 90k unless your thinking about a college proffesor or maybe private schools?

          ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 MammothImplement1066 (👍 2): I saw a document of my own school (high school) and the teachers made around 90-120k, some quite a bit more. I’m in Canada tho

            ↳ **MammothImplement1066** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): That might be why, i was using stats from the US

        ↳ **clover_1414** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): How much $ they make depends on where they teach.

        ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): what are you on bro. name one teacher making more than 75k a year i dare you.

          ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 seanrosenkranz (👍 1): How is bro finding this comment a year later 

To answer, my teachers all make 100+ a year, and I’m not American. (Not everyone is, shocking!)

            ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): damn bruh for a comment that you posted like a year ago you sure responded quick asf lmfao and i just saw it bc im not on reddit 24/7. this is like the first time ive been on reddit in a BRICK and that would make sense why they make so much more. bc they dont teach in america. teachers in america are hardly sniffing 50-60k yearly

            ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): oh and how much is 100k in your currency vs the USD

              ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 seanrosenkranz (👍 1): 74k

**Mehroli** (👍 3): tho tbf in south asia food is also way cheaper, same pizza you would pay 5$ in the us would be 1,50$ equivalent in some countries

**solublekarma93** (👍 3): On a teachers salary that’s a whole heckin lot in America too

**SLEDGEHAMMAA** (👍 2): In the west, it's still a lot, but not an incredible amount if it's only once a year. $100 is only like 2 or 3 days or working minimum wage

**tacosbanos_inuranos** (👍 1): Depends on which South East Asian country youre in. If you are in Singapore that money is not a lot

**Ninja__Shuriken** (👍 1): I am a few years late but pizzas cost less here too

  ↳ **Lil_Phantoms_Lawyer** 回复 Ninja__Shuriken (👍 1): Yep. Same.

**Fancy_Cat3571** (👍 1): For a teacher that’s about half a day’s pay

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Unless you’re like a millionaire or something I think $100 is a universally-recognized lot of money

**xbwtyzbchs** (👍 1): >  in the west it isn't but here in South Asia..... It's a lot of Fucking money

and pizza in South Asia is a SHIT TON more expensive than it is here in the US.

**DepressedTestical** (👍 1): This ain’t fucking south Asia is it

**Scam_unlikely11111** (👍 1): My history teacher has ten year and has out dated books and charges 400 for them to be replaced he has a Camaro and a mini fridge he doesn't pay for none of his school stuff and when he did was a long ass time ago

**WubbaLubbaDubStep** (👍 0): Good point, I forget teachers have multiple classes, although I think OP alluded that they were maybe their only class.  If not, maybe her wife/husband does well?  I know if my wife was a teacher, I’d let her be extra liberal with spending on her kids.

**Scam_unlikely11111** (👍 1): Elementary is one teacher with one teacher

**waitingtodiesoon** (👍 1): Things are fine for us for now. We do have a hurricane maybe heading for us though so who knows what 2020 has left to throw at us

**waitingtodiesoon** (👍 2): Do teachers still hate teaching the materials for it? I remember they hated taking time out of their course schedule to teaching us stuff specifically for it.

**PayMeInSteak** (👍 1): I do have a vape. It's the only thing that actually helps me with the quit portion of the cycle. 

I have a lot of friends that smoke too so that's the REALLY hard part. They have no plans on quitting. Lol

  ↳ **jcutta** 回复 PayMeInSteak (👍 1): I've been mostly off cigs for almost a decade (I still smoke when I go to like all inclusives lol) but being around smokers still gets me hardcore wanting to light up.

Try using nic salts if you haven't. Any tobacco tastes like shit to me now when I use them.

**Aggravating-Abroad44** (👍 1): There’s more jobs that don’t pay than do. My wife’s been a teacher at 4 locations in Ohio and still makes half of what her pay should be. She has 10 years of experience. The problem with teaching is that you rarely get hired for experience but because your family. I’ve seen people sub for a decade and still not get hired when a spot opens.

**KingBellmann** (👍 5): I said that germans do NOT drive as far and much as Americans, therefore we don't need as much fuel and higher fuel prices hurt less...

**SpiderFlame04** (👍 2): I get that, but you’d think they’d give free tissues to an eighth grade class

**LiarsFearTruth** (👍 17): I agree but those are learned behaviours. Sometimes instincts win over education. 

Still doesn't justify it though, just trying to explain it.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 LiarsFearTruth (👍 11): [deleted]

    ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 17): Because the overwhelming majority of people are anti science and anti-intellectualism. 

Just bring up how faith is a form of superstition and you'll get bullied and mocked, by the same people who say are anti-bullying. 

People only like "wholesome" and "positive" science. 

Anything too real and the cognitive dissonance beats out their reason. These are all well known and recorded psychological interactions

**[deleted]** (👍 13): The guy he’s replying to said he didn’t understand why people cheat, the other guy was trying to express the dichotomy of our animalistic nature vs our self-awareness and intelligence relative to other creatures, this awareness can make animalistic things like cheating, fighting, murder, rape etc. seem unexplainable and horrible when they’re common in nature. I don’t think he was trying to be /r/iamverysmart he was just trying to comment on the guy who said he didn’t understand why people cheat

  ↳ **LiarsFearTruth** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Exactly. You nailed it. 


Even horrible "crimes" (we decided they are crimes) like murder and cannibalism and rape are just normal survival evolutionary behaviors in nature. 

We created society and its rules but our instincts are still there, waiting under the outer shell of civility.

**LiarsFearTruth** (👍 6): I'm saying the distinction between wild and not wild is arbitrary and made up by humans to distinguish ourselves from all other life. 


Scientifically speaking,  we are all just animals. There is no distinction.


Which explains the behaviour of our most savage members.

**MarkHirsbrunner** (👍 -6): Trust me, if you tell someone you are leaving because you want to date someone else, they will react just as badly, if not worse, than if you are caught cheating.

  ↳ **ZombieDonShula** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 15): So if they're both the same than do the more ethical one?

    ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 ZombieDonShula (👍 -9): My ethics are based on minimization of harm.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 12): Then adhere to your ethics. Minimization of harm would be to break up with your partner vs. cheating on them. Idiot.

        ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): No, it would be to keep them from finding out, that way they aren't made unhappy.

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 7): Or, you could be honest so they could break up with your toxic ass and they can move on to someone who will treat them right.

            ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Your bitterness is simultaneously funny and sad.

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 7): You are the one justifying cheating here bud.

              ↳ **LickLickNibbleSuck** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 1): Hey for some reason I can still reply to this old ass thread. You're trash.

      ↳ **ZombieDonShula** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 16): I pity whoever you're doing this to. I hope one day you'll see that they deserve love and your charade will do nothing but hold them back from that.

**[deleted]** (👍 9): Ye then that A- is more equivalent to a B+ or a B in systems where there's no A+.

Not a bad grade by any means, just looks better than it is when you're used to A- being really close to perfect.

  ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 7): Not necessarily though, because while the US system is designed in such a way that getting an A is possible through hard work, other countries have systems where getting the equivalent is simply not really a realistic goal. The tests are designed so that effectively everyone makes mistakes, getting even 90 percent right can mean that you are good at the subject, smart in general, and working very hard - anything less and lower grades are usual. I don't know if it's the case in Canada as well, but I think it's possible that that is why they changed the numbers for the letter grades.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 8): At LSE in London I remember something like a 60% was an A lol. The tests were much harder though..

      ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): Yeah exactly! It sounds really strange to Americans usually, but I've lived in the US and in Europe and the tests in Europe are just way harder overal!

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

          ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): Really? Where I live getting 90-93 is considered an A- and 80-84 would be a D+ (assuming A+ to D- scale). Our 75 is an F ):

  ↳ **ZahariasX** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's rough. F here is anything under 50. With 50s being Ds, 60s Cs, 70s Bs, and 80+ As.

**ScumlordAzazel** (👍 1): The grading scale at my university was different depending on the subject. Most were 10 or but basic engineering courses were 93 and up as an A and the really hard 0hysics classes had like 85 and up as an A.

I also know Canada secondary schools have different grading scales depending on the province. Can't remember what it was for post-secondary schools because I was only calculating US equivalent GPAs at my last job for secondary schools. India has grading scales where you pass so long as it's above a 34. 34 to 44 would be a D.

Also, most US high schools use the 10 pt scale.

He isn't doomed to lifelong idiocy; he can crawl out of the hole he's in, if he wishes to, but as of right now, he hasn't, and therefore, by definition, is an idiot. Sorry, but facts are facts.

Don't sell these as facts. They are not. They're your opinion, and nothing more.

> I do speak a second language

It's so cute watching you brag while you only speak 2.... Because I speak 4 languages, motherfucker. If you want to count my shitty Norwegian, I speak 5. I'm telling you this because by your logic I can declare you are also an idiot just because you know less than me.

Get over it. No one is an idiot because they're a beginner. If anything, being a beginner should be celebrated, because you're willing to learn something new.

> I don't see what's wrong calling a spade a spade.

Well, then you are a lost cause!

    ↳ **listenupsmartass** 回复 LastCommander086 (👍 1): Bragging? You presumed that I wasn't bilingual, and I simply refuted your shitty hypothesis. If anyone here's bragging, it would be you, but that's not the point. 

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

As it is being peddled as a *meme*, that means that it is tapping a collective acknowledgement that this has happened multiple times and that others can relate, so it should be plural.

But thou art not changing (nor am i) and quite honestly anyone still following along is not changing, just rooting for his team.  since I have better things to do, I will concede the final word to you below.  I won't be replying on this post after this.

**konamioctopus64646** (👍 2): You said the word you, which used to be specifically plural but has become a more neutral use, if you want to follow your “rules for clear, precise communication”, please use “thee” or “thou” to make sure you are using singular pronouns, because otherwise it is “incorrect usage that has been abused for so long that it’s accepted as common usage.”

  ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 konamioctopus64646 (👍 1): English used to have formal and informal.  I still use both.  But you are not deserving of being addressed as thou.  And neither am I.

    ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 2): Once again you use the word “you”, which was originally designed to be plural. Why is it that “you” can be used as singular, but “they” can not. This may come as a shock to you, but languages change over time.

**King-Of-Throwaways** (👍 7): Singular their has the added advantage of being inclusive to non-binary people.

**Diet_Clorox** (👍 3): Yeah I saw Oxford or somebody added the singular they to the dictionary last year and was [like](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/030/710/dd0.png), haven't we been doing that the whole time?

  ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): we have been! but a lot of transphobic people were like “wahhh it’s not in the dictionary that means it doesn’t exist” so oxford added it in iirc

    ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 3): SOO many older people I know are hung up on thinking that language is derived from the dictionary instead of the other way around. Probably what they were taught in school 50 years ago so a hard mental construct to break. 

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

      ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): the definition of -phobia is a fear *or aversion* and yet it’s so ignored lol

        ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

**[deleted]** (👍 3): Because there are a lot of “traditionalists” who learned those so-called rules and then also teach them. And there are also a certain group of language prescriptivists who think they ought to be considered formal rules.

"Do not use "their" as an alternative to his or her; "their" should be used only when referring to a plural subject. Each of the rules here offers a method of avoiding gender-based language."

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

Okay, so where is your explanation?
And why resort to slurs? I'm simply asking you

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I report to ~~slurs~~ mean words because you clearly cant read or comprehend what you’re reading, so why argue? The only way to lose an argument with a moron is to keep arguing. So instead of arguing, I’m going to make fun of you

            ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): But you never argued? You made a claim, with no explanation or backup claims.

Now, if you want to stop being a fucking moron and go away it be appreciated, because clearly you can’t comprehend what you read. 😘

            ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I can easily comprehend what I read. You where the one saying socialism is bad, on my comment, so clearly you were coming in to this, to have a discussion or an argument. I wrote my comment because I wanted to make fun of the far right, and you ate the bait, but then continued to not saying anything of substance, except that "in socialism, the elite is oppressed". Why comment if you don't want to  argue your case

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I never said the elite is oppressed you fucking moron for the love of God learn how to comprehend what you read lmfao. You came to make fun of others but ended up playing yourself. Great job lmao

                ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Okay then. Then "take advantage of" them. And you still haven't explained why, and I just wanna know why you think that would/do happen in socialism?

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I cant explain something I haven’t said, cant I?

**BanthaMilk** (👍 2): the reason everyone on reddit thinks the same is because no one is allowed to have their own opinion, thanks to the almighty downvote. we've literally had to create a subreddit called unpopular opinion just so people can share their general personal thoughts and ideas without being downvoted to oblivion and losing all their karma to a comment which includes an opinion that is not generally accepted by people. reddit literally has almost no freedom of speech because of this platform's nature to get into arguments about the smallest things e.g. I was in a discussion and I mentioned something about how Ancient Rome had freedom of religion and this guy replied to me saying "wHaT aBoUt ThE pErSeCuTiOn Of ChRiStIaNs?!?!?".

**chabbleor** (👍 1): I love sea food, with the exception of shrimp. I thought, "shrimp is the most basic sea food there is, so if I love sea food, I must love shrimp." So every time I go out with friends or whoever and get dinner, if shrimp is on the menu in some dish, I order it. But every time so far, I have not enjoyed it at all and ended up regretting ordering the shrimp soup or whatever. My friends now question my love of sea food.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): Also her problem wasn't him being shirtless it was that he got it tattooed onto him

People only like "wholesome" and "positive" science. 

Anything too real and the cognitive dissonance beats out their reason. These are all well known and recorded psychological interactions

**LiarsFearTruth** (👍 3): Exactly. You nailed it. 


Even horrible "crimes" (we decided they are crimes) like murder and cannibalism and rape are just normal survival evolutionary behaviors in nature. 

We created society and its rules but our instincts are still there, waiting under the outer shell of civility.

**AshToAshes14** (👍 7): Not necessarily though, because while the US system is designed in such a way that getting an A is possible through hard work, other countries have systems where getting the equivalent is simply not really a realistic goal. The tests are designed so that effectively everyone makes mistakes, getting even 90 percent right can mean that you are good at the subject, smart in general, and working very hard - anything less and lower grades are usual. I don't know if it's the case in Canada as well, but I think it's possible that that is why they changed the numbers for the letter grades.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 8): At LSE in London I remember something like a 60% was an A lol. The tests were much harder though..

    ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): Yeah exactly! It sounds really strange to Americans usually, but I've lived in the US and in Europe and the tests in Europe are just way harder overal!

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

        ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

Don't sell these as facts. They are not. They're your opinion, and nothing more.

> I do speak a second language

It's so cute watching you brag while you only speak 2.... Because I speak 4 languages, motherfucker. If you want to count my shitty Norwegian, I speak 5. I'm telling you this because by your logic I can declare you are also an idiot just because you know less than me.

Get over it. No one is an idiot because they're a beginner. If anything, being a beginner should be celebrated, because you're willing to learn something new.

> I don't see what's wrong calling a spade a spade.

Well, then you are a lost cause!

  ↳ **listenupsmartass** 回复 LastCommander086 (👍 1): Bragging? You presumed that I wasn't bilingual, and I simply refuted your shitty hypothesis. If anyone here's bragging, it would be you, but that's not the point. 

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

As it is being peddled as a *meme*, that means that it is tapping a collective acknowledgement that this has happened multiple times and that others can relate, so it should be plural.

But thou art not changing (nor am i) and quite honestly anyone still following along is not changing, just rooting for his team.  since I have better things to do, I will concede the final word to you below.  I won't be replying on this post after this.

**rejeremiad** (👍 1): English used to have formal and informal.  I still use both.  But you are not deserving of being addressed as thou.  And neither am I.

  ↳ **konamioctopus64646** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 2): Once again you use the word “you”, which was originally designed to be plural. Why is it that “you” can be used as singular, but “they” can not. This may come as a shock to you, but languages change over time.

**rejeremiad** (👍 1): I don't feel included in the singular they

  ↳ **King-Of-Throwaways** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 3): “They” applies to everyone by definition. Your feelings don’t factor into it.

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

      ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

                            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Its not. But it sure helps you not be a moron. A core concept you seem adamant on denying yourself.

    ↳ **RandomAmbles** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 1): It can save about 2 good years of a stranger's life. That's a lot of money, since it's worth that much coming from anyone.

Super nice teacher. Probably made a lot of kids feel better about their education in general. Mad respect.

      ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 MammothImplement1066 (👍 2): I saw a document of my own school (high school) and the teachers made around 90-120k, some quite a bit more. I’m in Canada tho

      ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 seanrosenkranz (👍 1): How is bro finding this comment a year later 

To answer, my teachers all make 100+ a year, and I’m not American. (Not everyone is, shocking!)

        ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): damn bruh for a comment that you posted like a year ago you sure responded quick asf lmfao and i just saw it bc im not on reddit 24/7. this is like the first time ive been on reddit in a BRICK and that would make sense why they make so much more. bc they dont teach in america. teachers in america are hardly sniffing 50-60k yearly

        ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): oh and how much is 100k in your currency vs the USD

**MarkHirsbrunner** (👍 -9): My ethics are based on minimization of harm.

                ↳ **Dylarob** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): What do you mean attempt? I’m not going to start making things up if that’s what you’re looking for. You seem hot-headed and sore over reddit making jokes on r/memes (which I find to be silly)

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Dylarob (👍 1): Yes but just because I seem that to you doesn’t mean you’re correct. I’m just pointing out shit content. You think I’m crying for some reason

  ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 5): Yeah exactly! It sounds really strange to Americans usually, but I've lived in the US and in Europe and the tests in Europe are just way harder overal!

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

      ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

**listenupsmartass** (👍 1): Bragging? You presumed that I wasn't bilingual, and I simply refuted your shitty hypothesis. If anyone here's bragging, it would be you, but that's not the point. 

My point is, I did not call him an idiot for being a beginner, I called him an idiot for having the nerve to flaunt his illiteracy for all to see, and furthermore, have the audacity to ask such an moronic question. You don't see me blabbering incoherently in what, Portuguese, for example, because I have the self-awareness to realise I would come off as an idiot, and if I were to speak to Portuguese, I would be, in turn, an idiot. 

Same goes for the budding English speaker over there. If he can't string together an understandable sentence, then I'd strongly suggest shutting the fuck up until you at least have the reading comprehension of a five year old, which the guy obviously doesn't have. Basic logic.

I would opt for the he version of the sentence, as it is clearer about person and quantity, and I have no qualms changing the gender of the pronoun if I later discover that it was different from the default selection.

              ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I still use thee and thou, but use is less common.  language does change, sometimes for the better, sometimes by brute force.  the debates matter.  as evidenced by the many words you have patiently dedicated to the topic, but they matter to me too.  the singular they was found its way in.  some have embraced it for political reasons.  and when dealing in certain specific cases, I can see its "value", but in general it is not needed and so we continue.  But thou art not changing (nor am i) and quite honestly anyone still following along is not changing, just rooting for his team.  since I have better things to do, I will concede the final word to you below.  I won't be replying on this post after this.

**konamioctopus64646** (👍 2): Once again you use the word “you”, which was originally designed to be plural. Why is it that “you” can be used as singular, but “they” can not. This may come as a shock to you, but languages change over time.

**King-Of-Throwaways** (👍 3): “They” applies to everyone by definition. Your feelings don’t factor into it.

    ↳ **King-Of-Throwaways** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 1): There’s obviously a major group not covered by “he”, but you already know this. Because for you, this isn’t about arguing sincerely; it’s about adopting any position that’s convenient until the opponent gets exhausted and gives up.

Try being sincere. It’s better for everyone, I promise.

      ↳ **yuhyeet999** 回复 ProfessorButtercup (👍 4): I'd say so! Good for you and hopefully by the time your a teacher we will have been able to make a few changes in our society so y'all are more appreciated and better compensated for work.

    ↳ **waitehosjoe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Unfortunately you have to work with the recipe given, and go all "hells kitchen" to make them turn out decent in the end. Except you aren't given the recipe, the kitchen is on fire, and you're expected to make them perfect without any help from the recipe-makers.

**Diet_Clorox** (👍 3): SOO many older people I know are hung up on thinking that language is derived from the dictionary instead of the other way around. Probably what they were taught in school 50 years ago so a hard mental construct to break. 

Phobia is another annoying one. "The dictionary defines '-phobia' as 'fear', so I can't be homophobic because I'm not *afraid* of gays."

  ↳ **failoutboy** 回复 Diet_Clorox (👍 2): the definition of -phobia is a fear *or aversion* and yet it’s so ignored lol

    ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

**[deleted]** (👍 2): You’re confusing style guides with English language. It is simply untrue that “their” as a gender neutral singular is bad English. It’s been standard English for centuries.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

**theboeboe** (👍 1): No you didn't. You said

"socialism takes advantage of the elite". That's all you said.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I clearly didnt. Read again ya fucking mook lmfao you’re still coming back

    ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): > Okay, socialism would be a great way to live our lives, if it wouldn’t be taken advantage of by the elite or those who don’t value another human life as much as their own

Okay, so where is your explanation?
And why resort to slurs? I'm simply asking you

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I report to ~~slurs~~ mean words because you clearly cant read or comprehend what you’re reading, so why argue? The only way to lose an argument with a moron is to keep arguing. So instead of arguing, I’m going to make fun of you

        ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): But you never argued? You made a claim, with no explanation or backup claims.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Remember when I said you couldn’t real at a level equivalent to a 2nd grader? This is what I meant lmfao

    ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Yes I can. I actually got pretty good grades. But you really need to learn how to have a discussion.

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I’m not trying to have a discussion with a fucking moron. I don’t see why you don’t know that after I told you repeatedly. Now, if you want to stop being a fucking moron and go away it be appreciated, because clearly you can’t comprehend what you read. 😘

        ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I can easily comprehend what I read. You where the one saying socialism is bad, on my comment, so clearly you were coming in to this, to have a discussion or an argument. I wrote my comment because I wanted to make fun of the far right, and you ate the bait, but then continued to not saying anything of substance, except that "in socialism, the elite is oppressed". Why comment if you don't want to  argue your case

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I never said the elite is oppressed you fucking moron for the love of God learn how to comprehend what you read lmfao. You came to make fun of others but ended up playing yourself. Great job lmao

            ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Okay then. Then "take advantage of" them. And you still haven't explained why, and I just wanna know why you think that would/do happen in socialism?

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I cant explain something I haven’t said, cant I?

                ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Ahh, I forgot the "by" my bad.

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): You also forgot your brain lol

                    ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Why so offensive?

                      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Why so underdeveloped?

                        ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Actually I am not. Even if I were, why would that be a problem? Being smart isn't all there is to life.

                          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Its not. But it sure helps you not be a moron. A core concept you seem adamant on denying yourself.

                            ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Nah, smart people can be morons

Because I don't really care what you call me?

                              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Seems like people been telling you this for a while then, dozen tit?

                                ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Not really? But there is no reason to get offended by it.
And I only have two tits, not 12

                                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I cant tell you how you feel as much as you cant tell me how I feel

                                    ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): And I never said so

                                      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Just like I didn’t say half the shit you tried to argue about, but the exact opposite. Funny how that works aint it?

                                        ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's just me being dumb and reading it wrong

**guess_its_me_** (👍 38): Sounds horrendous, but it’s just so bizarre that I mainly use it as a cool/funny story to tell, and laugh while telling it xD

  ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 6): That's the coolest way of dealing with that kind of metal fan PTSD. I'm also a little relieved, I was feeling a little bad for laughing since that bastard fucked your head pretty badly

    ↳ **guess_its_me_** 回复 71Atlas (👍 8): I mean it was a pretty even fight, the fam blade was bent after that (I’ve often been told I have a very thicc skull, and that probably saved my life

      ↳ **71Atlas** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 7): At least the fan learned his lesson then. Your dry humor is dope, I'm sure that thicc head is there to protect an even thiccer brain

      ↳ **Freelance_Sockpuppet** 回复 guess_its_me_ (👍 3): You’d have to have a pretty thick skull to pick a fight with a fan /s

But really, did you not realise the fan was there was was the goal to jump to it?

I caught a wooden bat to the dome that split the skin really good and the doctor said I must have a thick skull to have not come out with major concussion

**laughingashley** (👍 1): That could be support creepy, she might've thought his sincere gesture was showing obsessive stalker tendencies, you don't know her life lol jeez, why yell at me for it?

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Chode* I'm pretty calm. If what you said what a joke congrats, to me it came off as sorta condescending.

  ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Trying to see another person's perspective shouldn't seem like a condescending thing.

    ↳ **laughingashley** 回复 laughingashley (👍 1): It doesn't diminish your perspective to examine others', I mean

**GhettoComic** (👍 14): No you literally just said “in the west its alot especially for teachers” you implied its alot for everyone more so teachers. This isnt true, live in a big city and it really isnt much. Stop trying so hard to twist what I said.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 7): IT'S A LOT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT EASILY, SHUTCHO ASS AND GO PLAY STARDEW VALLEY WITH YOUR 3090

  ↳ **TotallyNotInsaneTaco** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 1): No one’s twisting what you said but that’s a privileged mindset dawg, it’s good that you’re able to spend that no problem but for most people $100 isn’t exactly a small amount y’know?

  ↳ **RandomAmbles** 回复 GhettoComic (👍 1): It can save about 2 good years of a stranger's life. That's a lot of money, since it's worth that much coming from anyone.

Super nice teacher. Probably made a lot of kids feel better about their education in general. Mad respect.

**Fourt-Nuyt** (👍 4): They make like 90k a year my guy 💀

  ↳ **MammothImplement1066** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): The average teacher salary at a public school is 53k a year. And the range is usually from 44k to 65k not even close to 90k unless your thinking about a college proffesor or maybe private schools?

    ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 MammothImplement1066 (👍 2): I saw a document of my own school (high school) and the teachers made around 90-120k, some quite a bit more. I’m in Canada tho

      ↳ **MammothImplement1066** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): That might be why, i was using stats from the US

  ↳ **clover_1414** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): How much $ they make depends on where they teach.

    ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 seanrosenkranz (👍 1): How is bro finding this comment a year later 

To answer, my teachers all make 100+ a year, and I’m not American. (Not everyone is, shocking!)

      ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): damn bruh for a comment that you posted like a year ago you sure responded quick asf lmfao and i just saw it bc im not on reddit 24/7. this is like the first time ive been on reddit in a BRICK and that would make sense why they make so much more. bc they dont teach in america. teachers in america are hardly sniffing 50-60k yearly

      ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): oh and how much is 100k in your currency vs the USD

        ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 seanrosenkranz (👍 1): 74k

**[deleted]** (👍 12): Then adhere to your ethics. Minimization of harm would be to break up with your partner vs. cheating on them. Idiot.

  ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 -2): No, it would be to keep them from finding out, that way they aren't made unhappy.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 MarkHirsbrunner (👍 7): Or, you could be honest so they could break up with your toxic ass and they can move on to someone who will treat them right.

      ↳ **MarkHirsbrunner** 回复 [deleted] (👍 0): Your bitterness is simultaneously funny and sad.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Dylarob (👍 1): I’m hardly heated. Feel free to quote where I was. I’m pointing out a shit joke on a shit sub

          ↳ **Dylarob** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Your excessive use of profanity indicates to me that you’re at the very least upset about this. If you’re going to keep being a silly goose, go play in a pond.

              ↳ **Dylarob** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): What do you mean attempt? I’m not going to start making things up if that’s what you’re looking for. You seem hot-headed and sore over reddit making jokes on r/memes (which I find to be silly)

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Dylarob (👍 1): Yes but just because I seem that to you doesn’t mean you’re correct. I’m just pointing out shit content. You think I’m crying for some reason

                  ↳ **Dylarob** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): I never said you were crying and I’m not even implying that my opinion can warp reality. Have a nice day ;)

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 AshToAshes14 (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

    ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

**rejeremiad** (👍 0): in the instance of this meme, the plural is more approriate.  is it not?

The example you give has been used enough in the past that many accept it as usable.   

I don’t know who drove my car but he obviously didn’t do a good job.

I would opt for the he version of the sentence, as it is clearer about person and quantity, and I have no qualms changing the gender of the pronoun if I later discover that it was different from the default selection.

            ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I still use thee and thou, but use is less common.  language does change, sometimes for the better, sometimes by brute force.  the debates matter.  as evidenced by the many words you have patiently dedicated to the topic, but they matter to me too.  the singular they was found its way in.  some have embraced it for political reasons.  and when dealing in certain specific cases, I can see its "value", but in general it is not needed and so we continue.  But thou art not changing (nor am i) and quite honestly anyone still following along is not changing, just rooting for his team.  since I have better things to do, I will concede the final word to you below.  I won't be replying on this post after this.

  ↳ **King-Of-Throwaways** 回复 rejeremiad (👍 1): There’s obviously a major group not covered by “he”, but you already know this. Because for you, this isn’t about arguing sincerely; it’s about adopting any position that’s convenient until the opponent gets exhausted and gives up.

Try being sincere. It’s better for everyone, I promise.

    ↳ **rejeremiad** 回复 King-Of-Throwaways (👍 2): I suppose anyone outside of mankind would be excluded, but I am not aware of any teachers who fall in this twisted venn diagram you have created.

**failoutboy** (👍 2): the definition of -phobia is a fear *or aversion* and yet it’s so ignored lol

  ↳ **Diet_Clorox** 回复 failoutboy (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

**[deleted]** (👍 -2): Then cite a source. Im welcome to new ideas, but ive never heard that their is officially acturate

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

**[deleted]** (👍 1): I clearly didnt. Read again ya fucking mook lmfao you’re still coming back

  ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): > Okay, socialism would be a great way to live our lives, if it wouldn’t be taken advantage of by the elite or those who don’t value another human life as much as their own

Okay, so where is your explanation?
And why resort to slurs? I'm simply asking you

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I report to ~~slurs~~ mean words because you clearly cant read or comprehend what you’re reading, so why argue? The only way to lose an argument with a moron is to keep arguing. So instead of arguing, I’m going to make fun of you

      ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): But you never argued? You made a claim, with no explanation or backup claims.

**[deleted]** (👍 1): Remember when I said you couldn’t real at a level equivalent to a 2nd grader? This is what I meant lmfao

  ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Yes I can. I actually got pretty good grades. But you really need to learn how to have a discussion.

    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I’m not trying to have a discussion with a fucking moron. I don’t see why you don’t know that after I told you repeatedly. Now, if you want to stop being a fucking moron and go away it be appreciated, because clearly you can’t comprehend what you read. 😘

      ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I can easily comprehend what I read. You where the one saying socialism is bad, on my comment, so clearly you were coming in to this, to have a discussion or an argument. I wrote my comment because I wanted to make fun of the far right, and you ate the bait, but then continued to not saying anything of substance, except that "in socialism, the elite is oppressed". Why comment if you don't want to  argue your case

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I never said the elite is oppressed you fucking moron for the love of God learn how to comprehend what you read lmfao. You came to make fun of others but ended up playing yourself. Great job lmao

          ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Okay then. Then "take advantage of" them. And you still haven't explained why, and I just wanna know why you think that would/do happen in socialism?

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I cant explain something I haven’t said, cant I?

              ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Ahh, I forgot the "by" my bad.

                ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): You also forgot your brain lol

                  ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Why so offensive?

                    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Why so underdeveloped?

                      ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Actually I am not. Even if I were, why would that be a problem? Being smart isn't all there is to life.

                        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Its not. But it sure helps you not be a moron. A core concept you seem adamant on denying yourself.

                          ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Nah, smart people can be morons

Because I don't really care what you call me?

                            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Seems like people been telling you this for a while then, dozen tit?

                              ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Not really? But there is no reason to get offended by it.
And I only have two tits, not 12

                                    ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Just like I didn’t say half the shit you tried to argue about, but the exact opposite. Funny how that works aint it?

                                      ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): That's just me being dumb and reading it wrong

**RandomAmbles** (👍 1): It can save about 2 good years of a stranger's life. That's a lot of money, since it's worth that much coming from anyone.

Super nice teacher. Probably made a lot of kids feel better about their education in general. Mad respect.

**MammothImplement1066** (👍 1): The average teacher salary at a public school is 53k a year. And the range is usually from 44k to 65k not even close to 90k unless your thinking about a college proffesor or maybe private schools?

  ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 MammothImplement1066 (👍 2): I saw a document of my own school (high school) and the teachers made around 90-120k, some quite a bit more. I’m in Canada tho

To answer, my teachers all make 100+ a year, and I’m not American. (Not everyone is, shocking!)

    ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): damn bruh for a comment that you posted like a year ago you sure responded quick asf lmfao and i just saw it bc im not on reddit 24/7. this is like the first time ive been on reddit in a BRICK and that would make sense why they make so much more. bc they dont teach in america. teachers in america are hardly sniffing 50-60k yearly

    ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): oh and how much is 100k in your currency vs the USD

            ↳ **Dylarob** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): What do you mean attempt? I’m not going to start making things up if that’s what you’re looking for. You seem hot-headed and sore over reddit making jokes on r/memes (which I find to be silly)

              ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Dylarob (👍 1): Yes but just because I seem that to you doesn’t mean you’re correct. I’m just pointing out shit content. You think I’m crying for some reason

**[deleted]** (👍 2): It didn't really make sense to me because there's no letter grade above an A+ and the student performance distribution was still aligned to the letter grades. It's also somewhat demoralizing to get 60% compared to 90% lol. Not sure what the reasoning is.

  ↳ **AshToAshes14** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

**King-Of-Throwaways** (👍 1): There’s obviously a major group not covered by “he”, but you already know this. Because for you, this isn’t about arguing sincerely; it’s about adopting any position that’s convenient until the opponent gets exhausted and gives up.

Try being sincere. It’s better for everyone, I promise.

i give up.  you have exhausted me.

**ProfessorButtercup** (👍 5): I want to become a math teacher, does that count? :D

  ↳ **yuhyeet999** 回复 ProfessorButtercup (👍 4): I'd say so! Good for you and hopefully by the time your a teacher we will have been able to make a few changes in our society so y'all are more appreciated and better compensated for work.

**waitehosjoe** (👍 1): Unfortunately you have to work with the recipe given, and go all "hells kitchen" to make them turn out decent in the end. Except you aren't given the recipe, the kitchen is on fire, and you're expected to make them perfect without any help from the recipe-makers.

**Groundbreaking-Baby6** (👍 4): *blinks 3 times*

  ↳ **LeviGabeman666** 回复 Groundbreaking-Baby6 (👍 4): Could you do it another time? I think I blinked and miscounted your blinking.

**Diet_Clorox** (👍 1): In my experience none of these routes work because they're not actually interested in the semantics; they're using them as a shield against being cast as a bigot. Their brain will shut down when faced with information that conflicts with deeply held convictions.

**[deleted]** (👍 3): If you ask old school grammarians, most will just tell you the same rules that they learned. Linguists, however, recognize that "singular they" exists is many languages, it exists (and is widely used) in English, it is widely used by revered writers (e.g. Shakespeare) as far back as old English and the origin of the rule is basically just a specific preference of a couple individuals that was propagated by grammarians of the time but is not based on any actual rule in the language (i.e. those same grammarians have no problem with plural "you").

**theboeboe** (👍 1): > Okay, socialism would be a great way to live our lives, if it wouldn’t be taken advantage of by the elite or those who don’t value another human life as much as their own

Okay, so where is your explanation?
And why resort to slurs? I'm simply asking you

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I report to ~~slurs~~ mean words because you clearly cant read or comprehend what you’re reading, so why argue? The only way to lose an argument with a moron is to keep arguing. So instead of arguing, I’m going to make fun of you

    ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): But you never argued? You made a claim, with no explanation or backup claims.

**theboeboe** (👍 1): Yes I can. I actually got pretty good grades. But you really need to learn how to have a discussion.

  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I’m not trying to have a discussion with a fucking moron. I don’t see why you don’t know that after I told you repeatedly. Now, if you want to stop being a fucking moron and go away it be appreciated, because clearly you can’t comprehend what you read. 😘

    ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): I can easily comprehend what I read. You where the one saying socialism is bad, on my comment, so clearly you were coming in to this, to have a discussion or an argument. I wrote my comment because I wanted to make fun of the far right, and you ate the bait, but then continued to not saying anything of substance, except that "in socialism, the elite is oppressed". Why comment if you don't want to  argue your case

      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I never said the elite is oppressed you fucking moron for the love of God learn how to comprehend what you read lmfao. You came to make fun of others but ended up playing yourself. Great job lmao

        ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Okay then. Then "take advantage of" them. And you still haven't explained why, and I just wanna know why you think that would/do happen in socialism?

          ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): I cant explain something I haven’t said, cant I?

                      ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Its not. But it sure helps you not be a moron. A core concept you seem adamant on denying yourself.

                        ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Nah, smart people can be morons

Because I don't really care what you call me?

To answer, my teachers all make 100+ a year, and I’m not American. (Not everyone is, shocking!)

  ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): damn bruh for a comment that you posted like a year ago you sure responded quick asf lmfao and i just saw it bc im not on reddit 24/7. this is like the first time ive been on reddit in a BRICK and that would make sense why they make so much more. bc they dont teach in america. teachers in america are hardly sniffing 50-60k yearly

  ↳ **seanrosenkranz** 回复 Fourt-Nuyt (👍 1): oh and how much is 100k in your currency vs the USD

    ↳ **Fourt-Nuyt** 回复 seanrosenkranz (👍 1): 74k

      ↳ **Dylarob** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): Your excessive use of profanity indicates to me that you’re at the very least upset about this. If you’re going to keep being a silly goose, go play in a pond.

        ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Dylarob (👍 1): Nah we just don’t give a fucking shit about swearing where Im from, it’s basically punctuation. What’s your next attempt?

          ↳ **Dylarob** 回复 [deleted] (👍 2): What do you mean attempt? I’m not going to start making things up if that’s what you’re looking for. You seem hot-headed and sore over reddit making jokes on r/memes (which I find to be silly)

            ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 Dylarob (👍 1): Yes but just because I seem that to you doesn’t mean you’re correct. I’m just pointing out shit content. You think I’m crying for some reason

              ↳ **Dylarob** 回复 [deleted] (👍 3): I never said you were crying and I’m not even implying that my opinion can warp reality. Have a nice day ;)

**AshToAshes14** (👍 1): I don't know either, I've always wondered about that. Only thing I can think of is that this way kreally exceptional students will stand out more? I think these countries usually don't really have AP classes and such to make that distinction.

**rejeremiad** (👍 2): he is just as flexible.  some just choose not to read it that way.

But really, did you not realise the fan was there was was the goal to jump to it?

I caught a wooden bat to the dome that split the skin really good and the doctor said I must have a thick skull to have not come out with major concussion

**theboeboe** (👍 1): I can easily comprehend what I read. You where the one saying socialism is bad, on my comment, so clearly you were coming in to this, to have a discussion or an argument. I wrote my comment because I wanted to make fun of the far right, and you ate the bait, but then continued to not saying anything of substance, except that "in socialism, the elite is oppressed". Why comment if you don't want to  argue your case

                ↳ **theboeboe** 回复 [deleted] (👍 1): Actually I am not. Even if I were, why would that be a problem? Being smart isn't all there is to life.

                  ↳ **[deleted]** 回复 theboeboe (👍 1): Its not. But it sure helps you not be a moron. A core concept you seem adamant on denying yourself.

Because I don't really care what you call me?

But thou art not changing (nor am i) and quite honestly anyone still following along is not changing, just rooting for his team.  since I have better things to do, I will concede the final word to you below.
